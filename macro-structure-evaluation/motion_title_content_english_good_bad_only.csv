10,【ゲスト: 大村さん、榎本さん】mixidea高校定期練習【2nd スピーカーの役割レクチャー + ラウンド】,THBT all employers should allow their employees to work from home whenever physically/technically possible.,"{0: ""Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. We think this motion has the tolerance of the employees' rights, employers' rights to maximize the profit of the corporation, and the employees' right to expand their choice. But we, as a government, prioritize the employees' rights, even if the employees have some damage by this motion.\n\nSo three things from the Prime Minister. Firstly, in the status quo, an employee receives harm by the force to come to the corporation in the building. Secondly, in the step-down, the employee can't expand the right-side choice, and the government has to prioritize. And thirdly, the employer's right just to maximize the profit is not prioritized, rather than the employee's right.\n\nBefore moving on, I'll explain regarding the policy. Firstly, we think the employer has to make the effort to guarantee the environment to all of the employees to take the telework. For example, if possible, they have to introduce the internet environment, and if possible, they have to make the new chat room in the corporation. But as long as possible, the employer has the right, has the moral obligation to make the new environment to the telework, so that is the stance from our side of the house.\n\nFirstly, the employee receives harm by the force to come to the workplace. In the status quo, many people who have the difficulty to go out, there is a very similar. For example, some people have to care for their parents, and some people have to raise their children. And some other people, they are very difficult to work, to come to this workplace. For example, they are very disabled, and they are very difficult to work, and so they are very difficult to long-distance transfer. So that's why many people, right now, have very difficulty to come to the work. Why is it? \n\n<POI> So if these employees have to take a look after these parents at home, how can you guarantee that they'll be able to concentrate on their work?\n\nI think also in the special treatment, it's also existing in the status quo. But we think, without admitting all of the employees, also these people have the difficulty. That is also explained by this argumentation. \n\nSo why is this new specialty, sorry, why only some people are admitted, and it's so difficult in these workplaces? Firstly, the other member feels uncomfortable with the special treatment. Sometimes, this colleague thinks they are very subordinate at home, they are very cheating in this workplace. But also, these targeted people are also uncomfortable, because they also know that other people don't have the satisfaction to meet. So that's the reason why, in this special treatment, it's also harm to these people, they have the difficulty to come to these workplaces. That's the reason, I mean, as they're abiding to the protection of all of the employees, this, all of the admission is very important. So that's the reason why we think the norm, the employee come to workplaces is already normalized. So to break up this norm, we think that to admit all of the members is very necessary in the first place.\n\nSecondly, ladies and gentlemen, in the after-plan, they can expand the lifestyle choices. For example, in the after-plan, the reason is very simple, the mother and the father who can't find this kindergarten, and this is a very small number of the kindergarten, basically in the social program. However, in the after-plan, even if they cannot find this kindergarten, also they can, both of the parents can work at home, and at the same time, they can also care about the children. That's the reason why many different and diverse people can equally work at home. Also, sometimes if they live in Shimane, but they want to work in Tokyo, regardless of the birth rate, regardless of the condition, they can get the benefit at the same time in the first place. \n\nThat's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, after taking this policy, what is the sole benefit? Firstly, regardless of people's environment, regardless of their condition, they can fairly work. That's the reason why in the status quo, only the people who are very, very hard person to work with are only unfairly disenfranchised to get the benefit in the first place. That's why to diminish this unfair damage, this policy is very important in this case.\n\nThirdly, why the employee's right is not so important compared to the employee's right. Opposition might say the employer also has the right to make a maximized profit, and without a maximized profit, also it gets harm to this employer. That's why this employer's right is also important. But we think, as long as possible, the employer has to prioritize the employee's right. \n\nThe reason is very simple. Firstly, the employee is very weaker than this employer, so they can't resist against this employer, because if they are against the employer, they have also the possibility to be fired by this employer. That's the reason why, even there are some difficulties, this employee can't resist against this employer. That's why, as a moral duty, this employer has to protect this weaker position in the first place. \n\nSecondly, this employer doesn't get the harm so huge, because the reason is very simple. Also, by this policy, this employer has the chance to hire many diverse people, even in the theater and graduate in Harvard, even in this workplace in Shimane. That's why, ladies and gentlemen, also, if we can expand the admission, this employer also has the possibility to get the benefit. That's the reason why, as long as this employee also has the chance to benefit, this employer's right is not so important in the first place. \n\nThirdly, also, society already admits to protect the weaker position, even if the employer has the harm. For example, in the society, also, this society holds to the cooperation to hire the disabled people. Of course, if we can hire some percentage of the disabled people, this maximizes our profit. Unfortunately, it's not so achievable in the first place. \n\nBut, ladies and gentlemen, this workplace is very important to live. Without this workplace, many people can't live in the first place. That's the reason why, in order to protect all members of the society, this society already admits to the employer's harm in the first place. That's the reason why, in this policy, it's also applicable to protect the minority people so we get the support."", 1: ""I will talk about two issues in my speech. Firstly, I will talk about why forcing all employees to be in office is critically important in certain instances in order to maximize productivity. Secondly, I will talk about why the corporations, in general, have the right to force employees to act in a certain way. But before that, I will give a response to the House.\n\nFirstly, they generally talk about the interests of the employees. Firstly, we are not going to oppose a voluntary implementation of work from home by the employer in the first place. If the employer feels it's necessary or it fits the current trend, the employer will voluntarily do so. And recently, those kinds of corporations are actually increasing, especially in the current outbreak of COVID-19. So we think that candidates of those kinds of job hunting have a certain choice to move to another company if there is a dire necessity to work from home. \n\nBut secondly, in special instances, for example, the mother or father who has to take care of the child all day, or maybe the disabled person, we think in this kind of exceptional case, the states are already enforcing certain welfare for the employees in the first place. For example, the companies have to allow the employees to take care of the elderly, or the company has to hire disabled people. So we think in that kind of instances, the companies probably have a voluntary incentive to allow those disabled employees to work from home if there is a dire necessity. But we think that forcing all employees to work from home is damaging for some instances, which I'll explain later. \n\nSecondly, they talk about, well, this is also beneficial for the employees as well. Once again, we are not going to oppose voluntary allowance of these work from home. So we don't think it's an issue in today's debate.\n\n<POI>Under special treatment, for example, in parental leave, the other employee doesn't regard them as the same employee. Also, this norm is also harmful to these people. Why is it so justifiable? \n\nWell, we don't think this is going to be a huge stigma in the first place. The mandate of child care leave or maternity leave is already spreading in society. And also, the mandate of hiring disabled people, or those kinds of norms, is generally spread in Western democracy. We don't think it's a huge deal in today's debate.\n\nSo on to the first issue, why forcing all employees to be in office is in certain instances critically important. So we have the three-level analysis as to why being in office is critically important for increasing productivity or efficiency or speed. Firstly, we think that transparency so that employers are able to check whether the employees are effectively working is quite important. Because if an individual works from home, for example, they can be distracted because of their children. Maybe they talk to them, or maybe they have to talk to their families, and so forth. They may not be able to be focused on the work all the time and all the day.\n\nAnd also, there are certain communication barriers that are going to increase. Because if, for example, two employees are in the office, they are able to cooperate.\n\nThirdly, we think that in terms of security, being in the office is critically important. Because if individuals are allowed to work from home, maybe their information in the personal computer may be seen by their families or their friends. Or maybe, for example, if people are able to work from home, they can work at a cafe or outside their home. In that kind of instances, there's a certain possibility those kinds of information may be revealed to the member other than the corporation employees. But we think that for these reasons, the productivity or efficiency or speed may decrease.\n\nAnd the government might say, well, this efficiency or productivity is marginal. But we don't think it's marginal. We think in certain instances, this lack of efficiency or a bit of delay of the work is critically damaging for the corporation. Because oftentimes, these corporations have to conduct their working in a limited time. For example, in case of the insurance industry, usually March or December is the renewal period. And during that limited period, these kind of workers have to do a lot of work. They have a lot of tons of negotiations. They have to prepare for a lot of presentation or paper material so that they are able to negotiate. And one delay or one day delay or one hour delay may lead to a decrease of the profit, decrease of the premium from those kind of companies. Or in case of tech companies, for example, that people have to repair the error or bugs in the system. We see, for example, this is a finance system, that the one day or one hour delay of repairing those kind of bugs lead to the massive loss for the company or massive loss of trust from the customers. We think this is going to be damaging for the company in certain instances. \n\nTherefore, that these kind of corporations are more likely to not allow, no thank you, to employees to work from home. And we think that being in the office and doing the work as efficient as possible is extremely necessary. Therefore, we think that corporations have to do so.\n\nSecondly, the corporation right, right? So, generally, corporations have the right to limit the employees' choice. In other words, they require employees to act in a certain way. Because the fact that the corporation are imposing the working, meaning that the corporation are already depriving their work, their time in the first place. Or if necessary, for example, the corporation are able to require getting certain qualification in case of the accountants are actually in accordance with the need for the work. Or in case of the teacher, teacher cannot express political opinion during the school, whatever, so forth, because it's required as a job, right? So, in accordance with the job, that corporation are able to limit the action of the employee in a certain way, right? \n\nAnd we think this applies to this motion as well. Because, as I said, that being in the office and increasing the efficiency is critically important in some way, right? \n\nAnd we think the only exception we have that the corporation are not able to do so is that there is a dire need in the first place. For example, in case of child care leaving, like requirement of having disabled employees. Or maybe that, for example, the corporation have to, corporation, like, there's a certain limit on the working times. We agree to that. \n\nBut we think that as long as corporation are fulfilling those kind of minimum level of the requirement by the government, we think that it's immoral for the government to require even further. Because those kind of efficiency is extremely and critically important for the corporation's sustenance, for the stakeholders as well. Therefore, we beg to oppose."", 2: ""Because employers are at the top of the company, we believe that their salary is high and their social status is stable. Because of this, we believe that, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. Their salaries are low compared to their employers, and their social status is unstable, and they are easily fired by the company when the company faces depression. And we believe that, at this point, the most vulnerable actor in this debate is that employee. And we believe that that's why we have to force all companies to allow their employees to work from home. And that's why we have to take this plan.\n\nSo, first of all, let me rebut the first argument. So, they talked about the productivity will decrease because of the work in the home. So, we have three rebuts here. First rebut is about the employees' benefits. As our first speaker told you, this plan is giving employees more options. And because of this, more employees can work in the company. For example, people who live in Shimane can also work in Tokyo. And not only people in Japan, but also people in a foreign country can also have a large capability of working. The company can also hire these kinds of people if we take this plan. And it will be easier for them to hire these kinds of people. So, first of all, again, there is some benefit for the employers. \n\nAnd the second rebut is about the productivity. So, they said that productivity will decrease. However, in the 21st century, we believe that most of the work is done by facing the PC. So, the desk work is prioritized in the company. So, we believe that these kinds of work can also be done in the home. Although they are in the home. Because they also have enough facility in their home. \n\nAnd the third rebut is that even if it decreases the productivity of the company, we believe that the government has the right to force employers to accept these kinds of damage to some extent. For example, as our first speaker told you about giving example of that company has to hire disabled people to some extent. So, we believe that even if it decreases the productivity, it should be allowed.\n\nSo, let me talk about three things in my speech. \n\n<POI>So, the world you're envisioning is where you're going to have teachers. You're going to have all these employees working at home. How can you guarantee all these security issues are going to be resolved under your house? \n\nSo, we believe that the security issue of this debate, security can also be well done in our paradigm. Because we believe that in taking after this plan, we believe that almost all companies will have the environment for providing these kinds of facilities. And we believe that these kinds of home working will be much more done in our paradigm. We believe that much more technique will be developed in our paradigm. So, we believe that these kinds of security problems can be solved in our paradigm.\n\nSo, let me talk about who should we save in this debate. So, who is the most vulnerable actor in this debate? So, this is the employee. First, the point is that employees are more sensitive. Let me talk about the employers. They are top of the company. Their salary is high and their social status is stable. So, they will not be damaged by some minor change. And they only face difficulty when the company has a huge debt. And these kinds of things are much less possibility. \n\nAnd compared to employers, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. So, their salaries are low and their social status is unstable. Because they are easily fired by the company when they face this depression. So, we believe that at this point, employees are more sensitive. And because of this, they are the most vulnerable actor in this debate. \n\nThe second point is why do we have to protect the most vulnerable actor? Why do the employers have the duty to protect these kinds of things? This is because the employers get benefits from the employees. So, they have the duty to protect all of the employees. And especially have to protect workers, vulnerable workers. For example, like people who have to raise their children. Who have to care of their parents. Who have difficulty in commuting because they are disabled. They have handicaps. And these kinds of people will be most harmed without help. So, we have to save these kinds of people. \n\nAnd for example, like in Japan. As I told you, there is a law that employees should hire some number of disabled employees. And so, we believe that in this reason, we have to protect most vulnerable employees. And that's why we have to take this plan.\n\nAnd let me talk about why forcing all employees is important. So, first of all, this is because it is difficult for employees to say out when there are some exceptions. So, employees have less power than the employers. So, it's difficult for the employees to say that I would like to work in their home because of their childcare. And we believe that in this point, we have to force all of them not to make these kinds of victims. Thank you."", 3: ""I will explain our first argument, the importance of variation in the space of people's lives. I will explain the merit of employees and how to go to the companies. In the first place, if a lot of employees don't go to the company, there is no reason to go to the office. It is a very serious point. As the first speaker told you about communication, if an employee wants to do a meeting, they can't do it smoothly because their house is built out of bad reasons. I will explain later. Also, the employee can't correspond quickly to work at home. I will explain this reason.\n\nFirst of all, I will explain in the case of employees. Why is it important to go to the company? Because they can limit the quality of life of the company. This reason is that employees can separate their time to their life and working time. The company is a very important space to work. \n\nHowever, after taking this motion, bad things will happen. First, some employees will neglect their work for some reason. First reason is that they can't concentrate on their work. For example, if there are a lot of young children at home, they will cry. They want to pray for their parents. It is very serious because the father or the parents can't do their work or can't do the meeting. Also, the case of women is very serious. Of course, women want to take care of their children. However, if working from home is okay, women have to take care of their children. It is impossible to concentrate on their work. \n\nThe first reason is that the company may take a guarantee. For example, a set of nursery or maternity leave. It is important to concentrate on their work. The company can get profit. \n\nThe second reason is that the relaxed time will disappear. The company presses their work out of work. It is very serious because employees will be impressed with the amount of work at home. It is very serious because the family time will disappear. They can't relax in their home. Variations of people's life will disappear. I will explain the second reason.\n\nThe second reason is that the company has to make a profit. Employees can regulate their private time. Go to the company's merit. Employees can see the amount of work. They can prevent overwork. However, after taking this plan, employees can't see the amount of work. Employees will have a lot of tasks. It is very serious for the situation. \n\nThe second reason is that productivity will decrease. As I told you, the concentration will decrease. The quality of life will decrease. It is very serious to spend life. It is very serious for not only the employees but also the company and employers. Employees are confused about their private life. If we take this motion. Therefore, I oppose this motion. Thank you."", 4: ""The most problematic issue surrounding employees is that the employers just seek for profit and only have a narrow point of vision based on their old-fashioned working experience and aren't realizing the true benefits given by the work at home, the telework. That's actually why we're going to say that we should allow all employees to work at home. \n\nFirstly, we'd like to do two things. Firstly, we'd like to do rebuttals. Secondly, we'd like to compare their point and our point.\n\nThey said that there is some kind of discommunication problem. You cannot tell other people that you want to do some kind of work or other things. But firstly, if it's that kind of situation, we think that we should introduce this kind of telework to all people. Because if you are the least person who is only doing telework, it's very hard to tell other people that you want to do something at home. For example, I want to take care of our parents at home. It's very hard to say. Because of this, it is very harmful for the individuals because individuals cannot choose these kinds of things. \n\nBut secondly, even if they can take this kind of work at home, it's very hard to say. Because it's what one person is going to do at home and other people are working at the office. It's very hard for the individuals to say, please help our work. We think that it's very impossible. So we don't think that this kind of thing is good. \n\nBut rather, we think that these kinds of problems can also be solved by the telework. Because even when you're doing telework, we have Discord, Skype, Twitter, or other kinds of things, which we can tell other people, please help my work. We think that we can do these kinds of things, even in telework. Why didn't they contribute? We think that these things are enough. \n\nSecondly, about the maternity leave or other things, we actually told you that these things, even these kinds of maternity leave or welfare, maybe they're spreading a little. But if we're doing these things voluntarily, it is not spreading worldwide or nationwide. Only a few, only a small number of companies are doing this. And it is not being the fundamental solution. That's actually why we're going to say that all employees should be allowed to do telework. Because we want to liberalize all people by forcing it. And the companies will have the incentive to introduce these kinds of things. And it's going to make or develop these kinds of services.\n\nThirdly, about the security check. All right, well, we don't think that this is very relevant to this motion because we're talking about if it's related to technical impossibility or not. But firstly, we're just talking about technically possible or if it's technically possible or not. And we think that because of this, this is not important. \n\nBut secondly, we say that even if you are in your company, these things are still leaking. We think that there is no difference between these kind of two. But surely, we say that if you're going to have telework and all employees are going to do it, other kind of security companies or other companies will have the incentive for you to make a new kind of security application. And we think that these kind of security can be solved by in this situation, such as these kind of working places. We think that it's going to be equal in these kind of things. We don't think it's a necessary point.\n\nAnd fourthly, they say that some people neglect their work because they cannot concentrate on their work. Well, firstly, this is a very stigmatized case, right? We say that even if you are at home, you can have some kind of concentration. \n\nAnd secondly, even if you cannot concentrate on their work, we think that these people will be fired. But if you are at home and you're going to do telework, you do your best in order to maximize your profit and not to be fired like that. And we think that because of this, the housewives or other disabled people can work at home and do their best too. \n\nFifthly, they say that they cannot relax at home or QOL will decrease. Why would this happen? We say that we're going to restrain long-time work or other things. If you're going to have more various lifestyles and if you can't have private and also work, even in telework, you can't have your private time. Because if you cut Skype or other kinds of working things, you can have your own private time. No, thank you. We think that is very important. And moreover, we think that QOL will increase because you're going to have more various lifestyles. This is why we're going to be liberalized from these small workplaces to old-fashioned workplaces or other things.\n\nWe're going to compare our points and their points. Firstly, we'd like to compare whether working at home physically and psychologically is possible or not can be the criteria of not allowing work at home of employees. Always, they say that the most important thing is to protect the productivity of the company or other things. But firstly, this is old-fashioned thinking. We don't see the truth. If we're going to introduce, we think that this can be done. But firstly, we don't think that this kind of productivity can be prioritized than the individual's working style or other things. Because we say that because of this old-fashioned thinking, the individuals cannot have the right to choose this kind of work at home. \n\nAnd because of this, the disabled people, the housewives with babies or other people cannot work. And these people, the human resources are being corrupted in these cases. If we can introduce these people, we think that we can have more productivity. We can produce more things. And this can enrich these things. \n\nBut secondly, we think that even if it's going to have some kind of harm to this productivity, we think that the vulnerable people in society should be protected. Because the government or other people have the moral duty to do this, the moral obligation. \n\nSecondly, we'd like to say that we can benefit more on the employees and more in competitive markets. We say that in the future, we have to introduce this kind of work. And because we're going to introduce these things, we think that these companies can enrich their market too. That's actually what we're going to say. We should take this motion. Thank you."", 5: ""I think the world they envision is a world that is divided by digital lines. I think it is a world of social isolation, where employees face external job issues, but also internal home issues at the same time. \n\nI would argue that the biggest strategic mistake of the government was that they were going to force these employees to work at home. The funny thing is, they claimed that employees were vulnerable, but it seemed to me that at the moment in which they introduced this forcible plan, I think it's pretty clear to say they're going to be exploiting them more.\n\nI'm going to be looking at this debate in two metrics. First, I'm going to be looking at employee benefits, and secondly, I'm going to be talking about company benefits, given the context of both speeches.\n\nLet's first look at employee benefits. I'm going to be talking about two things here. Let's look at the argument of a birth lottery, and you could just work anywhere. They came up here and just stuck to this example of you can hire graduates of Harvard working at a company in Shikimane. First, I don't know how realistic that example is. \n\nI think that's a pretty minor case, but let's say that's a very prominent issue and that we need to actually look at this. I think the issue is that there was no process. I will stress that the biggest issue is that there's probably going to be no central institution because everyone's going to be working at home. What this means is that there's going to be things like online interviews, online meetings, and the issue is this, is that there's no transparency, right? Just because you're a graduate from Harvard doesn't mean they're necessarily capable or that they're capable of doing everything without any kind of mystique. \n\nI think that there are issues like miscommunication when you work at home, that I think these kind of miscommunication and just an increase of procrastination are a lot of things that are very viable. I think that the comparison we need to make is that when you're together and you're able to talk together and you're able to monitor each other to see if they're doing the correct thing, we think that's going to be much better. Therefore, we think that the issue about having graduates from Harvard isn't something so necessary\n\nBut I will argue that even if it was so important, I think it's possible on our side because if a multinational company, I think it's possible to have a lot of companies in different places. So the talk about Tokyo and Shimane is also achievable on our side. I think the talk about different companies around the world is also an issue that is very resolvable on our side. Therefore, I think this talk about birth lottery is something that's rather much better on our side.\n\nSecondly, let's talk about the quality of life. The context they gave was that, hey, have to look after children or hey, that these children have to look after their elderly because they're weak. Given that this is a debate about all employers forcing all employees to work at home, I think they also needed to defend the cases where they didn't have anything. They didn't have any kind of children. They didn't have any parents living with them. I still, given this context, I don't think there's any just reason to forcibly make people stay at home and work there where there could be a lot of security issues, a lot of miscommunication and force these people to stay at home. \n\nBut let's say, and let's look at these contexts of having children and grandpa. There's two issues. First is that they say that you could concentrate at home, but I don't think you could really concentrate with a crying baby in the background. I think you're going to be rather focused. I don't think that having your own internal issues at home, but also job issues is necessarily a good thing.\n\nBut we agree that this argument, this rebuttal isn't enough to resolve this certain issue of, well, having these elderly or having children. And I think that the biggest thing that I want to stress and the thing that government whip never addressed was that these problems like women's issue, like unequal pay, no maternity leave is not a problem of employers not allowing their employees to work from home. I think it is an issue of employers not taking any active and sustainable measures to ensure a sustainable environment. Therefore, I think that what we could do on our side is to make sure that there's going to be maternity leave, make sure there's going to be a sustainable environment, make sure that people don't have to suffer when they go from home and make sure that they have enough opportunities to look after their parents or children. \n\nThe government whip only refuted this by saying that, hey, this is only happening a little in the current status quo. Then, hey, if that's the issue, then we will mandate it, right? We don't think that it's necessary to just make it voluntary on our side. We're happy to reinforce these kinds of articles and laws. Therefore, I think in the general quality of life, our side is going to be much better because you don't blur the line between work and life.\n\nAnyway, miscommunication happens in the workplace. Why does this extend to become a reason to oppose emotional? I'll talk about that in my next point about companies, and I'm going to involve that in the story about security. There's two points to look at company benefits, and I think it's first, security, and second, productivity and profit overall. \n\nFirst, let's look at security. I think this is a very important point because these kinds of miscommunications, these kinds of information processing, and the privacy is literally what is able to maintain a company's life. That is the information of a new product or consumer data is something that is really important, and I think it wasn't simply enough for government whip to say, hey, it wasn't so important.\n\nThey said that, hey, it happens on our side, but I think that the biggest issue is that it's going to happen more on their side because I think the security breaches and hacking is a very urgent issue that has to be ultimately resulted where people are able to simultaneously work together in a working environment and try to combat that issue.\n\nThe problem is, on their side, you're going to have people perhaps sleeping at different times, and if you're going to be living in different time zones, you won't be able to simultaneously deal with these kinds of things or miscommunications, which could potentially lead to different products and different types of chaos. I think that when you're separated, you're not going to be able to face these issues much better unless you're going to be in this cooperative environment. Therefore, upon security, I think it's a big issue, and I think it's something that's going to be worse on their side. \n\nLastly, let's look at productivity very simply. They said that, hey, if people don't concentrate, you can fire them. The issue is twofold. First is that it's going to be hard to see if they're concentrating in the first place. That's why it's going to be extremely hard to regulate this.\n\nBut second, it's not easy for the company to fire people because they're literally the companions of a company. I think if every employee is procrastinating, you can't fire everyone. Therefore, upon productivity, we see it's going to be much worse on their side. \n\nWe think there's going to be security breaches, miscommunication, and a lot of overall breaches of employers' rights. I think that ultimately, all their benefits can be obtained on our side. Therefore, we think we should win this way. I'm very happy."", 6: ""Two Clarifications. Firstly, we are fine that if it is in the interest of the employers, they are voluntarily going to do so. And the current rise of these trends is actually increasing, meaning that there are other companies that are able to allow the employees to work from home. \n\nSecondly, they talked about what employees generally have the right. That's a general idea. We agree that to a certain extent, employees have a right, but employers also have a right to a certain extent. This is a matter of extent; therefore, we have to assess the pragmatic consequences as to why or whether this policy is uniquely beneficial or harmful for each actor.\n\nMoving on to the first issue - the interest of the employees. The problem with their case is that many of their problem depictions were not uniquely relevant to the motion. They expected the problem of the child raising issue or disabled people or the stress due to the working. We think those kinds of things are already measured by countermeasures such as the mandate of childcare leave or the mandate of hiring disabled people. Also, the annual aggregate working hour is quite limited by the law. \n\nWe think those kinds of countermeasures are already seen in the status quo, and they didn't really explain why a blanket allowance is necessary.\n\nThe deal we already told you, and which was unresponded by the government side, is that it can be worse for the employees, this policy, because there's a boundary between working and private life that is going to diminish under their house. We think that if these employees feel pressured by the corporations to work well, as they characterize, probably they're always thinking about working during breakfast, for example, during dinnertime or immediately before sleeping. They may be pressured to start to open the computer and start to work. We think that this is a thing that currently many employees are actually claiming in the status quo.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion here is that the benefit or interest of the employers they describe can be better in certain instances, but it can be worse in other instances. They didn't really explain why holistically overall, the likelihood of the employer being better off is quite high in the first place. \n\nAlso, of course, we already told you that the interest of the employers or the company is quite urgent. They say it's marginal, but we think this marginal one day, one hour delay can be critical.\n\nFurther, we already told you that the communication barrier is going to decrease, people can be distracted by childcare, or people can't do private tasks while working or maybe those kinds of so forth. We think due to that, their work may delay one day, one hour, or maybe weeks. We think those kinds of marginal time differences are critical when it comes to the tech company like fighting against the finance, errors, or bugs in systems, or maybe that if companies have to negotiate with the customers and the business partners in the limited time. \n\nAlso, there's a certain security concern, irrespective of the technology, that the risk of the information being seen by other people is going to increase. This is crucially problematic.\n\nLastly, the overall comparison. What this is, as I already told you, that got failed to explain or depict in the picture why this policy is uniquely necessary, other than any other measures in the first place. We already told you that we agree that this time and efficiency or the speed may be marginal, but this marginal difference is quite critical for the corporation productivity in certain instances. \n\nWe think that this policy is the override invasion or too much invasion of the corporate autonomy and rights. This policy is unjust."", 7: ""So why we have to force all employers to allow their employees to do the work. So first of all, we are not forcing all employers to like employers to work in telework. \n\nSo and why we have to force all employers to allow employees to do telework two reasons here is that the first reason is that it is difficult for an employee to claim when they are not all allowed. So only one employer has less power, and it's difficult for them to say that they want to do telework. Although all other employees are working in a company, they will be feared to be fired by the company, and they cannot say such a thing, and they will have a problem in the care of their parents or care of their children or in the commuting. \n\nAnd the second point is that, first of all, now there are little numbers of companies which allow telework. And we believe that in this point, we have to force all employers to allow their employees to work in their home because without these kinds of things without these kinds of things that which forces all almost all companies will not allow them to work in their home.\n\nWhat was our proposal? What was our proposition goal? Proposition goal was that giving more opportunities for people to work, for example, like people who have to care parents or children. And this impact is big because these kinds of people will be face difficulty in finance if they cannot work. We, the government side of proposition side, are giving these kinds of people the opportunity to do work, even though, although even they have some say how they have some how they have to care their parents or children. And why did and what was the opposition side thinks? The opposition side was about productivity.\n\nSo what was our refutation? First about this communication. So today, there is no need to we do have no there's no need to communicate face by face. For example, like we gave the example of email or line or Twitter. This communication will not will not occur and will will not occur in these kinds of paradigms. \n\nAnd second about the security issue. First of all, we think that these kinds of things are out of the debate because it means that it is technically technically impossible to secure these kinds of security. However, even if it is in this debate, we believe that the security company will have the huge incentive to develop the technique, and they will do it will be realized that they have no security issue until work. \n\nA second about the mutual exclusivity about the employees' benefit; they said that employers' employees' benefit quality of life will decrease because of the telework. However, this is not exclude this is not unique to our this is not unique because they these kinds of employees can only have to choose to work in the company, not in the telework.\n\nSo let me have the comparison. So first comparison is that we should be safe. So the comparison is that we should be safe. So we believe that the most vulnerable actor in this debate was the employee because employers are tough. They are the top top of the company. They have high salary. They will not be damaged by minor change. \n\nOn the other hand, employees, they are weak. So they they can they will face difficulty in finance if they cannot work for these kinds of people. This issue, this plan is vital for themselves. So we believe that we have to save these kinds of vulnerable actors in this debate. \n\nAnd we also believe that it's also the employer's duty to save these kinds of vulnerable workers. And it's too selfish to, like, get only the benefit from the employees, like, hiring only like, which seems to be benefit for themselves. So we believe that it's also the employer's duty to save these kinds of vulnerable actors as long as they get the benefit from the employees. Thank you.""}"
11,【スマホでpolice brutalityを潰そう】mixidea高校定期練習,"THW financially reward people who post videos of police brutality on popular sites (FB, YouTube, TikTok).","{0: ""Although we can still consider that several kinds of active movements taking towards these kind of several kinds of political or social issues in the current situation, we can't deny the fact that still past discrimination still exists in the current situation, which is actually leading to, for example, police brutality, which is the main topic of this motion. For example, like black people being oppressed by police officers in the United States. This is a current situation.\n\nSo as our stance at the government side, we believe that the problem here, in order to solve these kind of problems in the current situation, the vast majority of people, like the vast majority of people, like who just don't under actually exactly understand what's happening in the current situation. These people who just are so ignorant that they don't even know what's going on. The key problem to actually solving these kind of issues is to actually letting these people know about what's happening in the current situation, actually providing them the correct image.\n\nAnd we believe that actually taking this by taking this motion, we can intensive and incentivize people to actually take part in these kind of actions and will therefore actually spread a correct image and actually make more people understand what's happening in the current situation.\n\nBefore I move on to my two points today, today, I would like to start with a definition and model. So today, as the government side, our definition is that we define political brutality. For example, using, we like to use several examples that are happening in the current situation. So in the United States, black people are getting killed or, for example, in even in Japan, Kurdish people are being attacked in Shibuya. And we believe that these kind of situations are what is called police brutality in the current situation. \n\nAnd secondly, my model, our model is that we'll actually give the people who post videos on these kind of popular sites, for example, TikTok or YouTube, for example, I don't know, a thousand yen to five dozen and just like not a sufficient amount, but just like a little amount that you can buy like your dinner or something like that.\n\nSo moving on to my two points, my first point is that increased media people can be exposed to. So actually, so I would like to explain first, how will actually, how will these medias like, or these, the amount of these videos increase in the current situation. So I'd like to compare it with the status quo. So in the status quo, when people are basically walking on the street and encounter these kinds of social issues, what will happen is because like, first of all, like the, either don't have interest, like they don't want to be related to these kinds of issues because it's so sensitive. They will actually try to avoid these kinds of situations and not really interact actively interact with this kind of situation. \n\nBut because after we take this motion, people can actually gain money. They can actually save, save their savings for like one meal, like they'll actually be incentivized to actually, actually take part. All you have to do is just basically take a video of this whole situation uploaded on the internet. It's so easy. It's, there's no reason actually to avoid this. And we believe that actually many kinds of people will actually take action to, in order to just take videos and upload it on the internet.\n\nAnd the uniqueness here is that because these kinds of popular sites are so popular, trill millions and billions of users around the world are using this. Once someone or like several people upload a single video, several people will access to it. Several and thousands of people ask it. And actually what, and actually the videos or the news that these kinds of situations happen will spread tremendously among these people. \n\nAnd actually I would like next, I would like to explain why it's increasing the amount of these kinds of videos important. So I have two announcements here. First A, that the chances that people can actually see or witness these problems will increase. So the current, the problem in the current situation is that even if these kind of police brutality cases are happening, like only a few people upload these videos. So like not many people can actually have the chance to access to these cases in the current situation. But actually, just as I explained, if we take this motion, the chances that people, because there's so many people uploading videos, the chances, definitely the chances that people can actually have one look of these videos will tremendously increase. And therefore the chances that people can actually witness this problem will increase. \n\nAnd secondly, we can actually provide many aspects of this problem, not only from one perspective, like only one person standing from one angle, not those kinds of situations, but actually tens of thousands of people can actually take these videos and actually understand the whole image of the current situation.\n\nAnd the importance here is leading on to my second point. My second point is spreading the correct image. Before I move on, yeah\n\n<POI> Are you going to financially reward every single people that posted video?\n\nThat's what has been said.\n\nSo next, moving on to my second point, spreading the correct image. Okay. So what does the status quo look like here? Like because there's several reasons why we cannot portray this correct image of these kinds of social actions. For example, the news does not have enough screen time to actually focus on one, one problem. Like, because they only have like, I don't know, 30 seconds to portray a picture. Like they have to cut off many other kinds of parts and only show, for example, the parts that the, that the black person was shot by the white person, but by the white, um, by the white police officer. And like, because of this, people don't actually understand what is, what has happened in the background. They don't even know who actually started the fight, who actually, like what kind of, what kind of, um, conflict happened in the past. So people basically cannot understand the background.\n\nAnd secondly, because for example, only one video or only one image like has been posted on the internet. They don't even know what it's actually the whole image, the whole, um, the whole image of the situation. They cannot understand. They cannot perceive what has actually happened.\n\nBut after we take this motion, because we can increase in number, just that I explained previously, what will happen is that people, people in general can actually understand what is happening because not only the scene they're getting shot, but also like, like from the whole start, like who started the fight or like who actually started the punch, who like those kinds of like, like those kinds of cases can actually, people can actually perceive and people can actually understand by looking at those cases.\n\nAnd obviously the most cases of police brutality in the United States, like are usually the police, the white police officers, like starting, start to like, um, starting to like, uh, argue with these kinds of black people. And in most cases, actually the white people are the, are the people who have started this whole cases. And they're the actually, they're the actually ones who are bad. But if we only portray the scene that someone has been, um, someone has been, um, punched by someone, like people can not actually know what's happening and the impact here is that basically what is crucial in solving these kinds"", 1: ""This motion will only lead to, and will only do such a shallow thing, and only solve the very thin and outer layer of the problem that we are actually facing. So our stance is that if we have the money to financially reward those people, it is better to use those money to things like the education for the, for things like the better education for the police, and the additional aptitude test for the police. And this will lead to much better consequences and much deeper solution of the problem that we are actually facing. \n\nSo we have three arguments, and first is that this motion will only, will not solve the core of the problem, and second that the public will just see the superficial facts and not the core of the problem, and third, I will talk about the alternatives that we can take.\n\nOur first argument is that this motion will only solve the superficial and the shallow things. So what is the core of this Chinese brutality problem? The issue is that police are abusing their privilege, their job, and their social position to the public. Because police are the institution that supervises the public, they do not have the absolute and clear organizations that supervise those police, unlike the citizens. And because they don't have this absolute institution that supervises them, the police have this feeling of superiority towards the public.\n\nAnd even if we take this motion, this idea that police are having will not be terminated at all. Yes, the police might have started thinking that they should not do such violent things because they don't want to be criticized by the media or by the government or by the public. However, this is just a superficial change. And this will not alter the fundamental idea that police are having, which is the superiority that they are feeling, and which is the true cause of this whole problem. So if we want to truly solve this problem, if we want to solve this problem from the cause, from the true cause, we have to change police minds. However, this motion will not be achieved by this.\n\nBut with our alternatives, which I will be talking in my third argument, if we take that alternatives, we will be able to achieve this.\n\nAnd moving on to a second argument, that people will, that the public will just see the superficial facts and not the truth, not the cause of the problem. So also the public will start acting with superficial motivation, and also that they will not, and also they will not move on to action actions to prevent or interfere with the police brutality. So in short, what I want to say in this second argument is that this motion will only lead to superficial actions that only damages the society and not solve the actual problem.\n\nMoving on to a third argument, which is the alternatives. If we have the money to financially reward those people, why can't we use those money to do better education of the police? Well, when we see the reality, it is the fact that the quality of police is declining severely. And if we were able to enhance the quality of the education that police are having, we'll be able to improve the police. And the improvement of police will not only lead to the solution of this police brutality, but it will also lead to other better consequences, such as safer and better security of the society. So for this reason, we believe that we should not take this motion. And if we want to solve the problem, we should spend those money to other things such as the education of police. Thank you."", 2: ""So, our goal is to find the police for terrorism. And this is because of their public eyes. And this can be made by giving financial rewards to people. So, I would like to add an argument.\n\nSo, our third argument is if we take this motion, we can protect people who do demonstrations. And we have two reasons. First of all, about informed consent. And if we take this motion, we can do that. And second, people who participate in demonstrations can prepare for demonstrations because they can realize what the police can do or not. Like putting gases or etc. And this makes these people safe.\n\nSo, what is important? So, we have imagined that they have a strong will to participate. Like these people have a strong will to participate and don't care about their lives or their bodies to show their wills. But this is not true because they have rights to be safe because they are all humans and have rights to be safe. So, if we take this motion, we can protect those people. So, the opposition side must protect the police. But our side can protect those people. And this is our majority. \n\nAnd moving on to the rebuttal. So, they said about two arguments and one alternative. So, about the arguments. So, they said that if we take this motion, we have harm for the police. However, in this debate, police who do brutality can find by using SNS and upload it. And our world can change police minds because police have to be like not to discriminate people.\n\nSo, their alternative was to educate police and it's better than pay people. But we were financially, but police are all human and have feel to, maybe someone have feel to discriminate someone like black or Spanish or et cetera.\n\nSo, but our side is better than the opposition side because our side has more public eyes because they wanna upload videos and get rewards. \n\nAnd this movement will also affect the media because media will broadcast those videos, etc., etc. And police don't want to be on the TV as the opposition side also said. So, they will stop doing brutality. So, our side is more better.\n\nSo, I would like to move on to why is better than our side. So, we have, people can get financial reward if they upload video of police brutality. So, it will make the increase the number of video. So, at the opposition side, they also have videos about the police brutality. But our side is have more number of video. So, their side, the number of video is, they have few videos. So, there's an edited video in a worse way on purpose. So, if we take this motion, these videos will increase because many videos will be uploaded. \n\nSo, in the status quo, we have few videos. So, if they have the edited video and can make misunderstanding, it is not reliable. But if these would be uploaded on SNS, it will be the truth on those people. So, for example, a crew person received police questioning from a Japanese police last month or this month, maybe. But the person who took the video edited and just uploaded only the scene that the police hold the crew. But the police just did a questioning and there were no racial discrimination. \n\nSo, after plan, many people will upload some videos or upload many videos. So, some videos are the edited video. But others are the whole scene of the action. So, the number of the police who do brutality will decrease because we have public eyes more than opposition. So, maybe we have to consider about the video violence. \n\nAnd if the children watch, it might have a bad effect on them. But this is not true because it is a social issue. And if we take this motion, we can make the environment that children can think about the post-brutality or discrimination more than opposition side. So, we would like to propose. Thank you.\n"", 3: 'This is not enough situation, producing only violence and only a number of violence and muter. Because there is still discriminately thinking of people and police. Police are still prejudiced against people. So police can\'t arrest people, can\'t arrest every people equally. Like there are prejudices for black people, and these days this prejudice causes many problems for the world.\n\nNow I\'m going to move to the rebuttal. The government says that if we take this motion, we can protect people who participate in the demo. But this is not true. Rebutting isn\'t, can\'t protect people. Because this is only giving money to people, and the government doesn\'t have any radical solution, does not provide any radical situation. So this is not, this can\'t protect people. Because the police are prejudiced, and the people\'s thinking that they can\'t change, don\'t change. \n\nAnd the second, the government says that we can change police\'s mind. But these posts contain emotional posts, and these posts can\'t say the truth, totally true. So these posts can\'t change police\'s mind radically.\n\nNext, I\'m going to move on to our argument. You said that ""People who participate in demonstrations cannot be protected with the status quo. But if people watch the video, they can know what the police do or what the police can do."" But if people know about what police do or something, this does not directly protect them.\n\nNext, I\'m going to move on to the reconstruction and new arguments. If we take this motion, the revolt will become more big. Because there are three reasons. First, big impact more effect government. And second, some people disregard essence and get benefits by using this situation. And third, media is so unstable, and this may cause populism to the world.\n\nFirst, I\'m going to explain the big impact more effect government. The government side, he said that the government rewards all people posted about brutally police on SNS. But there is a question, how does the government manage a large amount of posts? So this is so hard and difficult. But this is exactly. Effective posts will be watched more by the government than small effect posts. And the government doesn\'t always reward. Like regularly demonstration or little accident. So rewarding all posts are difficult and are so hard. And the government doesn\'t have so much money. \n\nAnd there is an alternative to use money for other solutions. Like police, teaching police or something. \n\nSo for these reasons, bigger effect posts take attention of the government. And bigger effect posts definitely get a reward for people. Then people tell the magnificence of the brutality of police by posting. And then this may cause the magnificence of brutality on purpose. And this isn\'t a radical solution of brutality.\n\nAnd the second is my elder told that there will be a reputation of posts and something. So this is a more significant reward. \n\nAnd third their paradigm is so unstable. We can post things and pictures so easily and quickly. And these spread to the world so quickly. And it\'s easy to affect other people. And maybe not true sources spread the world. The problem is more significant. And this is not a radical solution of the accident. So we should oppose this motion.', 4: ""So, we can see the goal of, like, saving the people from brutality and saving the victims like black people and having some movement like hashtag Black Lives Matter. But what the problem we're trying to push is that as we, like, make financially reward people, the government will make chaos because of those kinds of, like, incentivize and as a conclusion, a counterproductive, like, situation will be given, proud to oppose.\n\nFor today's debate, I have two clash points, right? So, one, which methods can effectively achieve the goal, which is saving brutality victims to which can lead to proper discourse, right? So one, which method can effectively achieve, right? As I said in the POI, the reason why I did POI is to know how much money to use, right? But unfortunately, or fortunately, the government side said all of the financial reward people will be rewarded, right? But we see that a simple question here, how many Twitter users are in today's society? Millions and thousands, right? We see that as millions and thousands, what's more like going to cost, like millions and thousands of money is needed on the government side, right? One, this is unrealistic\n\nBut two, even if those kinds of situations are given, we have to use those resources in other solutions, right? For example, having like a high quality of police or teaching police what is the importance of like raciality or those sexuality or like treating those like criminals, right? So we think that our side, like an alternative, will be like emphasized and like furthermore, our solution will, our goal will be like set it and having a solution like effectively, right?\n\nTwo, which can lead to proper discourse, right? So let me like clarify again, what is the government stance, right? The government stance was like the vast majority can't understand like those instances. So we have to like increase the amount of reports, right? \n\nBut we have two responses for here, right? One, in the status quo, as my first and second speaker talk about, those video cost is fulfilled, right? The reason why like hashtag backslips matter or hashtag I can't breathe was like promoted, right? Just because those media were fulfilled, right? Those media like influence like appropriately and that like led to discourse, right? \n\nBut the second response, right? Like they are just like bystander effect, bystanders, right? By taking this motion, as my second speaker was talking about, like those, this motion will like simply make people like bystanders, right? For example, like just watching those instances and not like having an action and just like taking videos, right? \n\nWhat those two responses mean and why it is important, it's because people will just like move by money and not inherently like have a strong belief to attacking like those discriminations and like solving discrimination, right? We see that we also like want to save victims and we also want to like prevent those instances happening in the status quo, but what our side will achieve is that inherently like solving problems, such as my second speaker was talking about, like knowing about the fact and changing the structure of the police."", 5: ""So, in short, the opposition side couldn't provide any effective solution, counter plan, and also they failed to provide any harms of our plan. Therefore, we think that we won't start.\n\nTo summarize this debate, we can say that three ways can help those people who are being, like, being subject to police brutality. \n\nThe first one is education, and the opposition side has been supporting this. Okay, but the government side has said that, like, education will change politics' mind. But we think that, we only point out that the government is in charge of education, right? And we characterize government as something that is biased, or, like, no incentive to educate. And their characterization was, like, government are happy to do education.\n\nBut we think that our characterization won. Why? Because if the government is like what the opposition side characterized, those kind of, like, discrimination or brutal police, those kind of problems won't be happening in the first place. And we say that, in the first place, the whole point of this debate is, like, countering the government, right? So, we think that it is absurd to rely on government when we are countering government. We think this is obvious.\n\nSo, the other two ways are, like, through activism, and the third way is to, like, through helping people who are currently under threat, through, like, some people helping out people who are subject to police brutality, or, like, saving people who are participating in demos. As for activism, like, the opposition side seem to prove that the more better discourse will occur on the other side. Well, we already told you that the government is not a good source.\n\nBut, and the opposition side response was like, on our side of the house, the discussion will be superficial. But we already pointed out that superficial discussion is not something that is bad because that can ultimately help people, and the whole point is to help people, so that, like, whether it's superficial or not doesn't matter. We characterized that what we need to, like, turn people into action is to, like, show people the whole image of things so that people will know the, to know the full extent how police brutality is bad, or, like, how police brutality is, how the problem of police brutality is important. \n\nBecause we told you, like, the number, the whole people, the number is important. If people see more number of those videos, people will regard those police brutality as important, and we think that those are the most necessary thing for activism, and activism will gradually help people. But the most important thing is to help people who are currently under threat, right? \n\nWe think education or other things take time because we already told you, like, it is impossible or, like, takes a vast amount of time or 20 years or 100 years to change people's emotions or biases because, like, the, like, the hate against black or hate against, like, sexual minorities remains for, like, hundreds of years. We think that it is absurd to think that we can solve this problem in just, like, one year or something. And we told you that in order to help people under threat, we think that people need to know what is happening under police brutality, and we think that video is the only way.\n\nFinally, the last point, the opposition I have is money, but we are happy to sacrifice money, even if it takes money, because it is for helping people. We think that their point does not stand, therefore, we won't dissipate.""}"
14,【小石川高校 vs WSDC連合】高校定期練【高校生のバイトって実際どうなん】,THBT it is better for high school students to do part time job during their school life.,"{0: ""The school days are a really crucial period in our lives. During that period, high schoolers should experience as many things as possible. That's why we are happy to propose.\n\nSo, in the first place, let me define this motion. So we, the government side, follow the current law for part-time workers by which we allow students to work for no more than 10 hours a week. We set these hours because high schoolers should spend a certain amount of time on studying, not only part-time jobs. And also, if they extend these hours to the late night, there might be more dangerous jobs, more dangerous part-time jobs for high schoolers. So we fought to prevent those dangerous jobs. And for the first reason, we set these hours.\n\nSo, first of all, let me tell you what part-time job brings about for high schoolers. So, I'm going to talk about one thing. This is experience of society and working. Let's take an example of doing a part-time job in a family restaurant. There, we can interact with people of various ages. For example, from people of high schoolers and people of 30 years old and people of 60 years old. So, there are a lot of ages in having a restaurant.\n\nAnd by interacting with those people, interacting with those people is not experience that high schoolers can get in high school. This is because in high school, there is almost... High schoolers interact with only people of the same age, right? And even if they interact with people of different age, this is like one year older or one year younger. Students don't that much, that often interact with teachers. By doing part-time job, they can experience of society and working, in which there are a lot of people of various ages from young to old.\n\nSo, how is this? How is experience of society and working good for high schoolers? So, let me divide high schoolers into two groups. First, high schoolers who will go to college after graduation. So, for those people, doing part-time job can broaden their interest and know what they are suitable for and what they are not suitable for before college. This is really good for high schoolers because in college, they will do what they are interested in or what they want to do or something that is good for their future. By experiencing part-time job before college, in which they do what they are interested in, they can know what they should do in college or what is good for them before college. So, they can learn and they can do better things in college. The second group is people who will not go to college.\n\n<POI>How does washing dishes at Saizeriya benefit people who want to be, for instance, scientists or soccer players? \n\nI think people who want to be soccer players don't do part-time job in Saizeriya or come to restaurants like that. Because if they want to be a professional soccer player, they should practice. There is no need for them to do part-time job in Saizeriya.\n\nSo, now let me move back on to my argument. So, I'm going to talk about how is this good for high schoolers who will not go to college. So, for those people, doing experience part-time job is still good too. So, this is because they can experience society in advance. So, for example, if they start part-time job from the first year of their high school life, they can experience society for three years before being exposed to society, before the graduation.\n\nThis is really good for high schoolers who will not go to college because if they are not going to college, after graduation, they will just go to society and start working. So, by experiencing society in advance, they can learn what to do in society or how to interact with people in society. So, that means letting high schoolers doing part-time job during their high school days means that there will be much more time for preparation for society. So, this is also good for students who will not go to college. So, in conclusion, part-time gives high schoolers a lot of benefits for the future. As I mentioned, that's why we, the government, are happy to propose. Thank you."", 1: ""Panels, what you have to recognize in this debate is that part-time jobs that are available for high schoolers are not advanced. It's not like an internship that is available for university students. You don't acquire any knowledge. You don't acquire any particular skill that is going to widen your future choices. And it's just you're going to probably be exploited. You're going to be you're going to have to dish like wash dishes in Siberia. That's the kind of experience that you're going to have. It's not going to be in any way valuable for high school students. Therefore, we think that high school is better if high school students never experience part-time jobs during their school days.\n\nNow, two things to talk about. Firstly, I'm going to talk about why part-time job is uniquely harmful. Secondly, I'm going to talk about, in comparison to other alternatives, why part-time job is particularly worse on comparative. But just before we go on, just what are our stances and clarification? And then I move on to rebuttals to the side government.\n\nNow, what are our stances and clarification? We support academic and club activities of high schoolers. We don't support part-time jobs. And furthermore, we also think that the context of this debate needs to be probably about a developed nation.\n\nGiven that the majority of high school students who are from poor households in developing nations probably cannot afford school in the first place, probably are working full-time jobs, you know, as child labor or whatever. And furthermore, we think that this debate, I think the government would probably concede, should genuinely be about which side can provide better outcomes for high school students in the future, whether or not to experience this sort of part-time job or not to experience this.\n\nAnd the premise of our arguments is going to be that, I think the government is probably going to agree with me, that once you experience part-time job, you're likely to be encouraged to do so later, or you're going to be trapped in the cycle of working as a part-time job. Because the reason being that the fact that you get money, the fact that you get slightly economic independence from your parents is likely to attract many high schoolers and they're likely to prioritize the part-time job over school or over the club activities. We think that's a very likely situation that once you experience this, you're going to continuously work in a part-time job.\n\nNow, what then? So let's move on to the response to the side of government. What we heard from the government side, firstly, we heard that, you know, high school students should interact with people from different ages because in high school, you only interact with people from the same age. Firstly, the existence of teachers and parents are the counterexamples of this. \n\nBut secondly, we told you that like when you are in club activity, you would probably like carefully use, you know, respectful word which is keigo to your senpai or you would behave like in a way that you would behave yourself in front of your kohai and that sort of thing. You can still learn what you do in your communicative skill and social skill, even in the framework of school. \n\nThen we heard that they're going to widen the perspective in the future. No, it's not. They fundamentally mischaracterize what part-time job is going to be.\n\nNow, let's move on to the first point. Why part-time job is uniquely harmful. There are two things to talk about. First is that the part-time job is probably going to be manual labor in the vast majority of cases, like dish, like washing dish in restaurants, in McDonald's, that sort of thing. Because those sorts of jobs do not provide any knowledge, do not provide any actual experience that is going to be valuable in the long run. And they might talk about like internships, for instance, but in the majority of cases, like as for internships, the sphere of choice is extremely narrow because not many corporations offer internships to high school students, even though it's available in the vast majority of cases only and exclusively for university students. \n\nBut secondly, no thank you, is that they're likely to be exploited under the cheap wage because they're just high schoolers, right? They're not from any elite university. They're just high schoolers who are kids, right? So they're likely to work in really, really cheap wage. So we think that it's uniquely harmful.\n\nSecond point, in comparison to alternative, why part-time is bad. Now, there are two kinds of skills that I think matter in consideration of the future choices that children are going to have. One is communicative skill and two is academic skill. We think both are equally important, like when it comes to expanding the future of children as much as possible.\n\nNow, firstly, as for communicative skill, we think that it can be acquired through club activities, for instance, within the framework of school activities like you do, like you do debating, you do basketball, you do baseball, you do soccer, that sort of thing. Firstly, you're going to be able to learn how to interact with others, how to interact with your senior, with your junior. But secondly, like you're able to find what is fun for you, right? The fact that I was able to find my hobby, which is debating, has expanded my future opportunity in a great way, right? Now, I'm able to interact with these great, great people who are online right now, right?\n\nNow, secondly, as for academic skill, we think it's important to note that in developed nations, there's a prevailing norm that going to university is the prerequisite for your success. That is to say, when you apply for a job, you have to graduate from an elite university in order to expand the choice that you have in the first place. If you have a job that you want to apply for, you need to have graduated from an elite university. That's why we think that in high school, it's particularly important for you to go to a summer program in Tetsuryokukai, which is a cram school for students who want to go to the University of Tokyo, instead of wasting your time, like washing dishes in McDonald's.\n\nBut furthermore, the unique benefits that come in high school is that high school is a precious time, right? It's only three years. And in university, we say that there's not much like club activities, for instance. And we think that's why we provided the unique benefits that come with not experiencing and by experiencing other alternatives that are available for students. For all these reasons, we proudly propose."", 2: ""Club activities are completely different from part time jobs in that students should behave in a responsible way. If you do such a rude thing for the customer, you will be fired. At this point, we believe that the part-time job is completely different from club activities, which they can gain. And we believe that high school students should also have the time to do part-time jobs. And that's why we strongly believe this motion.\n\nSo, let me rebut the arguments first. So, the first argument is about the cheap wage. They said that because of the part-time jobs, they are accepting high school students. The wage will be so much cheap and it will be quite uniquely harmful for high school students. However, we don't think so that the wage is cheap for the high school students. As long as they are high school students, we believe that the money got by the part-time job will be enough for themselves to use things.\n\nFor example, they are not going to use money for their living. For example, like to buy a house or to pay the money for the house or to pay money for water, electricity. These kinds of things can be done by their parents, but they can use the money for the things which they like to do. For example, tapioca or soccer tools or something like that. So, we believe that this is not the cheap wage and it will be uniquely harmful for high school students.\n\nAnd the second point is about the students' future. So, they said that communication skill and academic skill are both important. And we completely believe that. We also agree that these both two skills are important. And they said that for the academic skill, they said that they have to graduate from an elite university. And because of this, they believe that they have to go to the Kyokai Ojuku.\n\nHowever, this is completely against the first thing that they also think that club activity is important. We believe that we can use the time spent for club activity. We can spend the time used for club activity for the part-time job. So, we believe that there will be not so much big difference for the time used different from the club activity.\n\n<POI> So, are you implying that putting on fake smiles at McDonald's is much better than interacting and having fun with your friends? \n\nSo, we believe that we do not have to completely diminish the time for club activity. We can decrease the time used for club activity to some extent. And we can use the rest of them for the club activity. And we can use some time for the part-time job. No, thank you.\n\nSo, then let me talk about the club activity. So, they said that interacting with people is the one thing. And interacting with people is the important thing. And it can be also done for the club activity. However, we believe that all the things done in the high school students, students have no responsibility to interact with others. So, they are not forced to talk in a polite way for their seniors.\n\nHowever, in the part-time jobs, they have to act in a polite way. So, they have to act in a polite way. And they can act with a lot of people. For example, from people like high school students to people seniors, for example, 60 years old, something like that. We believe that in this situation, we can much better learn about the communication skills. And the point that they have the responsibility and they can interact with many people.\n\nThen, let me talk about our second argument. Our second argument is that set the fundamental sense for using money. So, what is high school students? So, when you are a high school student, it is easier for them to use their money for what they like. For example, tapioca, games, perfume, for traveling. All these kinds of things are much more easier than when they are in junior high school or elementary school.\n\nThe second point is that they will use a considerable amount of money compared to junior high school or elementary school. For example, they get money 5,000 yen a month or 6,000 yen a month. The amount of money will become bigger and bigger. And we believe that when they are in the high school student period, they use a considerable amount of money.\n\nThe third thing is about why it cannot be done when university students. So, this is because when they are university students, parents cannot control the usage of the money they gain. So, on the other hand, when they are high school students, they are under the control of parents. No, thank you. Parents can control the usage of the money to some extent.\n\nParents can teach the important things, can teach the way how to use money. For example, when they are using all the money they gain from part-time jobs, using for games, only for games, and do not deposit some of them, parents can teach them that depositing money is also important for themselves when they think of the future. So, we believe that parents can teach the usage of the money to some extent, which is completely different from the university students' period.\n\nSo, why is this important? When they are high school students, they use money without thinking. They use money just for themselves and not think about the money, how their parents work, and do not realize the importance of money. However, if they do part-time jobs, they can realize how it is hard for themselves to gain money. We believe that if they realize such important things, they can use their money in a much better way because they will think much more deeply about their money. At this point, we believe that we can set a fundamental sense for using money, and that's why we believe this notion. Thank you."", 3: ""I think asking a 50 year old man what they want to eat for lunch is not meaningful interaction. I also think that washing dirty dishes for 10 hours a week wouldn't widen your perspective or help you recognize your dream job in any way. We think that part-time jobs are a meaningless distraction that prevents you from focusing on stuff like studying or like club activities or any other action that is actually needed for your life, and that is why we are so proud to oppose today's notion.\n\nA couple of reputations to the previous speaker before I move on to my main points. Firstly, they talked about how part-time jobs are better because you get more risk, you get a bigger sense of responsibility. He explained that because there's a risk of getting fired, you learn to be responsible and not to be rude and stuff like that, but we think that this kind of sense of responsibility or respect towards people who are above you can also be gained through clubs. We think that even if you do not get fired for being rude at club, you still have social status that you have to protect as club member, and in order to maintain the social status, you will be careful to be polite to seniors, teachers, and so on. So, you don't necessarily have legal contract with your boss to learn how to be responsible. So we think that the benefits are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThen they also talked about how you can interact with many. The first speaker talked about how you can interact with people from different ages, but as I said in the beginning, we think that the characterization of part-time jobs, that it's mostly manual labor, it doesn't really require this communication skills that you actually need, and all in all we think that like interaction can be further achieved on stuff like club activities with your friends or your seniors or your teachers, etc. etc., but you take him. \n\n<POI>So can all high students can act in a polite way in the club activity with no existing rules and no manners for themselves\n\nIt may be hard for high schoolers to be completely polite. But like first of all, I don't think we have that much of a burden to say that high schoolers have to be 100% within club activities because we also say that not all high schoolers would be 100% polite once they start like doing a part-time job, even if you have that legal contract. I think like that doesn't necessarily mean that all kinds of high schoolers would like suddenly be polite.So all in all what we basically want to see is that this kind of legal contract or your fear of being fired is not enough of a reason to say that like you, that say that part-time jobs are necessary to gain this kind of sense of responsibility. \n\nSecondly, they also talked about how, and I was talking about how you have to interact with like you get to interact with many people but because there's like a lot of, but because there's a lot of like manual labor involved in part-time jobs, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nFinally, they also talked about the sense of responsibility of using money that can be gained through part-time jobs, but we think that firstly they already contradict their main point when they say that students can learn how to take care of money, but at the same time they also say that parents would control it. We think that like this kind of control from their parents like your own like autonomy as like a. As like a spender wouldn't like be able to coexist so it'll either be the student like freely using their money or like the parents getting like a complete hold of their salary. So like either way, I don't get why they would be able to learn this kind of responsibility in the first place. \n\nAnd even then we still don't see the specific reason why they have to gain this kind of sense of responsibility while they're in high school. Especially if they have another four years or like for some people like six years in university. So in the end, we think that this kind of skill is not necessarily something that should be gained within the three years of high school life, but what we really need to gain during our three years of high school life is things like academic skills.\n\nFor communicative skills that my first speaker talked about which brings us back to our main points. Firstly, the role of high school education. A side opposition believes it's to learn like the basis of how to live in society in the future and like in the long-term, right? In order to do that, firstly, you need to gain like a lot of knowledge to either get into university or maybe it's to get into a specific job or whatever reason. Then you also need to gain things like communication skills, teamwork, or leadership skills, or other soft skills that you need to survive in society. You gain that through daily classes at school and after-school activities, clubs, and we think that these kinds of activities are something that you could only gain in the three years of high school education. Specifically, this kind of opportunity should be the highest priority for students.\n\nSecondly, I'll explain to you why this kind of opportunity would not be able to be achieved once students start gaining a part-time job. So ... the government second speaker said that the wage is not that cheap for part-time jobs, like it's enough for them to sustain themselves and have fun. We think that this is the specific reason why a lot of high school students will keep doing their part-time jobs even at the expense of their academic career getting damaged. Because you're able to gain that money to buy things like bubble tea or go to karaoke or whatever.\n\nThis kind of immediate pleasure and immediate financial gain that you can get from part-time jobs is what keeps the students going, and we think that this is very harmful because they don't realize that the long-term benefits that could be gained from studying or going to clubs would not be achieved. But then they prioritize this short-term gain that they can have from part-time jobs, and therefore they keep working. As a result, this is going to be a huge distraction that severely harms their future in the long term. Imagine you have to spend, they said that it could be like 10 hours or so, but we think 10 hours is pretty long for you to spend washing dishes or asking customers what they want for dinner.\n\nWe think that this is like a huge distraction for their lives, especially if they have this financial incentive that keeps them going at all costs. The specific difference between clubs and part-time jobs is that clubs in school are made to coexist with the school work. That is to say, like, you can only practice until a certain time. For instance, if you go to a club, there's probably a limit to the time that you can stay at school. Then, you also have a schedule of the club that is suited to your academic work. Maybe you don't have clubs during the test periods, for example.\n\nSo, we think that clubs are made to coexist within the school system, and therefore, it's really easy to balance your studying and all the other stuff. The unique thing about part-time jobs is that it's just not made to coexist in the first place. Therefore, what ultimately happens is you either get exploited or pressured by your boss to keep working at all costs and keep working for that money. This leads to getting distracted from a lot of the academic activities that you need to gain during your high school years. This would be a huge harm to your long-term prospects. For all these reasons, we're so proud to oppose."", 4: ""First of all, let me set ground for this, for my speech. So there's two analysis. First is what is high schoolers. So let me analyze high schoolers. There's two analysis. First, those go to college. And the second, those not go to college, as the first speaker said. So the important thing of this analysis is majority of students will work after high school. So let me move on to second one.\n\nSo skills they claim, the opposition side claim to be needed. So they argue two points. First, we need communication skills. And secondly, we need academic skills for high schoolers. So they focused on the harm, the harm part-time job have. For example, they, so their first point was harm to academic skills. However, we're very skeptical about the need for academic skills. So as we argued, the majority of students work after, will work after high school, meaning not going to university. So academic skill is not needed for like work, right? So just get into the university. So even though there's a little harm, which club activities will not have that part-time job has to academic skills, it doesn't matter because a lot of, a majority of high schoolers will work after high school. So as we argued, as we argued in the first speaker, primary working, part-time job, primary working experience is good for those students who works after college. \n\nAnd secondly, they argued club activity is enough for what we need. So let me compare club activities and part-time jobs. So there's two axes. First, age. So in club activities, there's just like a two-year difference between senpai and kohai. And also, they go to the, because they go to the same school, they have, they have common background. Meanwhile, part-time, in part-time job, the co-worker, the age and backgrounds of co-workers will vary. So communication skills or like some special experience towards a wider variety of people will be there in the part-time job.\n\nAnd the second axis is responsibility. So they, the opposition side argued club is not the place. So we can, we can have a sense of responsibility throughout the club activities. However, it is not enough because the club is not the place for responsibility. It's, so it's, it's the place for just fun. So even though there's, there's a few club activities which require responsibility, for example, like very strict physical clubs, there is, it really depends on the club's atmosphere. For example, so as we, I said, the club is just for fun. So generally, generally, there's no need to be responsible. \n\nHowever, in part-time jobs, there's legal contracts, as I said, no thanks. There's legal contracts, as I said. So there's, and also there's an exchange of money. There's an exchange of money in exchange for their labor. So, and also as the second speaker said, there's, there's always the risk of getting fired. So incentive, incentive for, to be responsible, it's far more stronger in part-time job.\n\nSo let me conclude my speech. So because the opposition side misunderstood what they needed, meaning they, so they misunderstandingly believe that academic, academic skill is needed. The harm they argued is meaningless. The harm they argued is meaningless. And also because, and also because club activities will not be the counterpart of the part-time jobs, we are happy to propose. Thank you."", 5: ""The problem that opposition bench faces with proposition bench is that they haven't been able to explain first what high school students want. And then we think that there wasn't any kind of clear description and explanation of the mutually exclusiveness of part-time jobs. I'm very happy to propose.\n\nTwo things I'll be talking about. First, I'll be explaining what high school students really want. And secondly, I'll be explaining what part-time jobs bring and why, in the majority of instances, there are going to be more harms than benefits of experiencing part-time jobs as uniquely as a high school student.\n\nSo first, what do high school students want? I'll be using the classification that the prime minister brings, which is first, people who want to go to universities and people who don't want to go to universities. I'll be explaining why, in both of these situations, there's going to be much bigger harms.\n\nSo first, let's look at students who want to go to university. Given that around 90 to 95% of high school students usually want to go to universities, and this is a debate about whether part-time jobs have benefits or harms as a majority. We think this point should be more important than the whip speeches wholly talking about students who don't want to go to universities. We think it's much better on our side if you don't experience part-time jobs for two reasons.\n\nFirst is because you gain more time to prepare and be provided and you have more opportunities provided to see what you want to do in the future than spending and wasting your time on part-time jobs, right? You're able to study, you're able to gain important skills and knowledge, which is essential to choosing universities and careers because you need to actually have information to do so. For instance, we think it's much better if you study biology to be a biologist, or if you study law to be a lawyer, or play sports to be a professional player. And we think these points are much more important, much more feasible and robust than just, than just, I don't know, for instance, smiling at Burger King or McDonald's, right? We think it's much better.\u3000This is especially important when you consider that you are a high school student and you only have a limited time of three years. We think it's most important to know how to use time management. We think it's much better on our side where you actually have more time to absolutely dedicate all your time on things that are actually important.\n\nOn their side, they say that, hey, we could also do club activities and you could just do both club activities and part-time jobs. Notice how this point specifically neglects the variable of high school students because a high school student usually has homework they have to prepare for universities. They also want to have fun with friends, right? The physical burden on mental stress is accelerated when you have to have both clubs and part-time jobs, right? Just one day is enough to save my energy and me having to go to a five-hour shift after that washing dishes for no reason is, I think, rather like meaningless and something that is rather unfeasible. On our side, we do not have these distractions. We also have time to work to polish our resumes for extracurriculars to provide to universities, for instance, which we think part-time jobs rather distracts you. So we say on our side, our side has much more benefits.\n\nBut secondly, we say it's much better for poor people because it's going to be a much better investment of trying to go to universities and actually find a good job and a good career and gaining much better income instead of sacrificing your time during your limited three years of high school trying to do something you don't know if you want to do that in the future. Instead, we think that it's irrational for the government side to come up here and just say that these high school students are always going to know what to do from just doing part-time jobs.\n\nBut let's look at the second case, right, of students who don't want to go to a university. The problem is this, is that they haven't been able to characterize these people, right? People usually who don't want to go to universities and immediately work are people who want to work at their parents' shop or being a fisherman or people with fixed jobs, right? These people already have jobs they want to do, so this negates proposition's own premise that these people would know what to do from doing part-time jobs because they already have jobs they want to do, right? At this point, we think this is meaningless and this is a waste of time because now they have to do things that won't help you at all.\n\nThe government says that academics aren't so important, but we say it is, right? Because if you want to work after your parents' shop, you should rather spend your time being able to focus on what the shop wants looking after all its geographical locations and how it's doing in the economy in the market, for instance, much than just working at a part-time jobs which you're never going to be affiliated without in the future. Therefore, we say it's better for these people to spend time on focusing on the job you're getting rather on their side. That's why for the first point, for what high school students want, our side is able to match the benefits more.\n\nBut secondly, let's characterize what part-time jobs and what part-time jobs brings. The whole bench of our proposition was that the part-time jobs extend high school students' vision of the future. This is problematic for two reasons. First, because it simply cannot because part-time jobs offered to high school students is usually the things like washing dishes at Caesarea, pushing buttons at 7-Eleven, or creating fake smiles at Burger King. Why is this so? Because we say there's a structural system in society which makes high school students have to do manual labor. \n\nThis is for two reasons. First is because as high school students, we don't have the certificate or achievements as other people who are higher of age. There's a lack of credibility for high school students which makes them have to do manual labor instead of in kind of high-tech programming, for instance. That's why it's worse on their side and it's much better on our side because we get to prioritize these friends. We get to prioritize our limited time at high school. We say we're much better in not having to waste time in all these meaningless manual labor, which you probably never have to use in the future.\n\nBut secondly, even if you neglect all our points coming up for now, we say that their side wasn't able to provide any kind of mutually exclusivity for this point. The only thing that came up here was that, hey, we could just do clubs too. I already explained why that doesn't work. The only unique thing that came up here was that apparently, you know how to use your money management. \n\nThe problem is, right after the second speaker came up here and said that if parents are able to control the money of high school students, that doesn't teach money management, right? It simply doesn't make sense. And it's also not related to the point where part-time jobs offer you money but don't teach you how to manage your money properly. If you want to know how to manage money, you should just do that with the allowance your parents provide you.\n\nAt this point, we think that failing in explaining the difference between part-time jobs while we explain it uniquely just in clubs or prioritizing your friends is much better. Because we prioritize the needs of students and talk to you about how part-time jobs bring more harms, I'm happy to oppose."", 6: ""The biggest issue with Proposition's case is that they do not have a clear benefit of what you could specifically gain from the three years of part-time job experience that you gained during high school.\n\nOn the other hand, what we as opposition have consistently been telling you from the beginning is that these kinds of academic and communicative skills that you could gain from your school classes or your club activities are something unique to high school and something that we need to protect. That is why we're so proud to oppose today's motion.\n\nSo let's go over today's debate. The two main clashes are which side has long term benefits that are actually useful for the child's future. All in all, we think that as a premise, we see the high schoolers because they don't have any academic record or a cool master's degree or something. We simply don't have the capability nor credibility to get into a really high skill job. So as a result, the majority of the part-time jobs that they will be experiencing is manual labor. This is like washing dishes or doing like asking what they want to eat for dinner or stuff like that. And we think that as a result, opposition fails to clarify the specific benefits that you can gain from these kinds of part-time jobs.\n\nSo let's take their best case and assume that this kind of legal contract makes you like a more responsible person. Even if that is the case, we still see that the kind of responsibility that you do gain out of it is quite marginal. We think that all you have to do to be responsible in a part-time job is simply to be at that shop at the designated time and do some chores. Right. And then you're like counted as responsible. We think that this kind of responsibility is not really valuable compared to the responsibility that you gain as a member of a sport team or like fulfilling your role as like a reply speaker or like whatever thing you do in clubs. We think that the kind of skills and the kind of responsibility that you ultimately get out of part-time jobs is quite small compared to the benefits that can be achieved on our side.\n\nAnd secondly, the other benefit that they talked about was about this kind of interaction that you can gain between people. Firstly, we say that their model already contradicts with their stance because it seems that high schoolers only get to work for like 10 hours a week. But still, we also see that like the kind of like manual labor prevents them from like any kind of like constructive communication with like peers or like people older than you in the first place. So compared to that, again, the communication that you can gain within the school is more sufficient and more beneficial for these students.\n\nBut finally, they also talk about the financial responsibility that they can gain through the motion. But we think that this ends up in like two spectrums. It's either you waste off all your salary on bubble tea or like your parents take all the cash. Right. So in the end, we don't think the high schoolers are capable and nor is it feasible for them to gain this kind of financial responsibility once they start doing a part-time job.\n\nSo let's look at the comparative. Right. What can we actually gain by preventing them from doing part-time jobs? We think that by focusing on your school life, whether it's like academic or whether it's something to do with clubs, we think that this has like a long term benefit on the students because first of all, they gain these kinds of soft skills, right? Like communication skills or like teamwork or like learning to respect your seniors or like fulfilling your role in like a team or like leadership and like other other skills.\n\nAnd let's look at like academic skills. Right. So again, let's take their best case and say that like most students don't go to university anyway. So academic skills are important. We think that like firstly, we think that academic skills are not necessarily like getting into that university or having like an elite record. We think that like even if you don't go to university in the end, like working hard to get that good grade on the test or like studying and like sharing your thoughts together with your peers is in itself like a valuable experience. Even if you don't go to university in the future. \n\nAnd compared to that, the kind of like tedious and repetitive manual labor that you're going to experience through a part-time job is like a meaningless act. And that doesn't lead to any useful skills compared to what you could gain from working hard studying.\n\nSo all in all, regardless of what kind of future that you are going into for the long term benefit and the happiness of the students as a whole, we think that they should never experience part-time jobs during their high school career. And that is why we're so proud to oppose. Thank you."", 7: ""Part-time jobs are an easier way for students to learn social skills. At a point that the manners are written and they have to behave responsibly, and they can learn how to use the money. At this point, we strongly believe today's motion. So, today we have two main points here. The first point is about the academic skills, and the second point is about the social skills.\n\nSo, first, let me talk about the academic skills. We believe that the students can also maintain a balance between the part-time jobs and studying. So, high school students have enough chance to think of the future. No one will do a part-time job all day when the entrance exam will be held two months later. So, they will be able to maintain the balance between studying and part-time job. \n\nAnd this is also done when it comes to club activities. Students are able to maintain, even now, the balance between studying and club activities, which is club activities are the same as part-time jobs. At a point that they spend about 10 hours a week, which is completely different from studying. We believe that they can maintain the balance between the part-time jobs and studying. And if they cannot do that, it can also be said that they cannot maintain the balance between club activities and studying. So, we believe that there will be no difference between the people who are doing club activities and people who are doing the part-time jobs and club activities.\n\nNext, let me talk about the social skills, which is the most important thing in the participation. So, they said that they can learn a lot of social skills in the club activities. They said that they can learn how to behave against seniors. However, they can learn a lot of social skills, for example, how to behave against senior people. However, we believe that club activities are completely different from part-time jobs. To the point that they can quit easily the club activities when they have some difficulty in the club activities. \n\nAnd also, the rules are not written. So, it is difficult for students to know the rules. Feeling the atmosphere and changing behavior is so difficult for high school students. On the other hand, in part-time jobs, first of all, the manners are written. So, it is easier for students to learn social skills because they can learn the manners while they are doing part-time jobs because the manners are written.\n\nThe second point is that they have to behave responsibly, and they can somehow find a way to get along with who they hate. And the salary can be a huge motivation for these kinds of things which cannot be done when they are in the club activities. Because if there are some people they hate, they can quit easily. But salary can be a huge motivation in the part-time jobs.\n\nThe third thing is about how to use money. So, what will happen if they do not do part-time jobs in high school and they just get a lot of huge money when they are in the universities? So, when they are in the universities, they can do a lot of part-time jobs and they will get a lot of money. However, there is no one who can tell the importance and tell how to use the money. So, at the point when they are high school students, parents can control to some extent. \n\nAnd this is important because the parents can realize, can make them know how it is important to use and how they can truly use the money for themselves. And in this point, we believe that the social skills gained by the part-time jobs are bigger than only done in the club activities. So, that's why we strongly believe this motion. Thank you.""}"
15,【政治家の私生活報道】mixidea定期高校練習,THBT media should not report on the private lives of politicians.,"{0: ""We agree that politicians have the power to change society through policies, but what we don't agree is the politicians becoming public property, where every single action is determined by the public, where the paparazzi is justified in walking around and, for instance, hacking into their phones and looking at private documents for the sake of their own profit. We think it is inherently unjust for the media to try and pry into the private lives of politicians at the expense where they could potentially have children or families who didn't consent to these behaviors. So I'm very happy to propose. \n\nLet me start off by explaining our stance. Three parts. First, is that we would define private lives as the world in which these politicians or members that are part of the private lives didn't give consent to. Realize that this is inherently different from public lives, which is literally their job as a politician, so we think that private lives are inherently the elements of life that are irrelevant to one's action of doing a job. \n\nAnd secondly, we would define media as anything that looks like social media, we think it could look at any kind of newspaper or magazine, we think it doesn't matter. \n\nAnd thirdly, is that we think that in instances of corruption, these are instances that are involved in security, and this is an issue that is involved in their own jobs as a politician, so we think in the case of corruption, we think that's kind of irrelevant to this debate, so we think that in those instances, that's basically a public matter for society.\n\nSo we think opposition really needs to defend the micro nuances of private lives, for instance, of which newspaper they walk to, or what house, where they live, or what kind of house they live in. That's the kind of comparison we want to make.\n\nGiven this, I'm going to bring you two arguments. First, I'm going to explain to you why politicians have a right to private lives, and secondly, I'll be explaining why this is bad for public discourse. \n\nFirst, let's look at why politicians have a right to private lives. Two reasons. First, is because we think that this is just a natural reaction of the rights we give. Because if you look at the status quo, politicians are given some certain extent of protection. For instance, they have the right to property, that is that we don't allow people to access their bank accounts or invade someone's house. Why? Because we think this is information that is inherently only relevant and important to that specific person, and people around them don't have a right to know it. \n\nWhat does this suggest? This suggests that this motion is just a natural extension of the rights we give. For instance, we think that there is no justification or any kind of need for the public sphere to know which politician goes out to eat with, what kind of things they do with their children or their family, and we think that it is unjust for the media to just pry on specific and wavy information for the sake of their own. \n\nWe think it is just in saying that these politicians should be able to live a life where they don't have to fear paparazzi escaping around, at the point in which we already give certain rights. We think this is just a natural extension, we see no problem. \n\nBut B, is because politicians never consented to this in the first place, right? Because we think the private lives are inherently elements of life that these politicians didn't give consent to, right? At the point in which we infringe consent, even at the bypass of one instance, we say this is a slippery slope, with at the moment in which the media can infringe upon the consent of an individual, we allow the media, for instance, barge into houses or looking at private documents of a policy, and we think this is never justified, and at the moment in which we should never cross the line of consent. \n\nBut let's take the best case scenario of politicians, that is that politicians don't really care about their private lives, so we should be able to do whatever we want to do. Even if politicians still gave some consent, we think that it's still not legitimate. Why? Because we think that other factors and other variables are included in private lives, who didn't consent to this in the equation. For instance, it could look like family members, or friends, or children who didn't agree to having their every single action being exposed by the media. \n\nWe think that it is inherently justified to not report on the private lives when there are third-party harms. We think it is unjustified for a politician's wife to be surrounded by cameras every single day asking about a potential scandal of a politician, where innocent children are trying to be asked by popularity every single day of how they think their dad is, right? We think that those kind of third-party harms, at the point in which they didn't consent to these kind of behaviors in the first place, we think the media never has a justification. \n\nGiven that politicians have a right to private lives, why should this override the authority of the media? Which is probably going to be the argument coming from opposition. Two reasons. First, is that we think that the role of media should not be provoking or inciting these kind of issues in the first place. Why? Because we think the media should be news that just shows reliable information and not try to create some fake news in the first place. \n\nWe think that what's going to happen in the status quo is that these medias are going to be profit-incentivized and they're going to sensationalize issues. So we're very able to see situations where these media or newspapers are going to aggravate a politician and broadcast them in a very false way and try to incite violence and portray these politicians as someone that is radical or sexist or homophobic. \n\nRealize that these private issues of sensationalization are different from public issues like corona or murder because these issues are inherently public. And these public issues mean that it's very easy for the public to say, to see if this is fake or not. But the problem of this sensationalization of private lives is that there's no other source to determine the credibility. So that means that the public is only able to trust that piece of unreliable source and take it as true. So even if a politician is not racist or homophobic, if a media tries to broadcast their private lives as being racist, then everyone believes the politician is racist and we think that's inherently evil. \n\nBut B, we think the private lives are irrelevant to the public actors, public actions of politicians. We think that as a politician, you do have a duty to give good policies and cater for society. But we think that what they do at home, their own actions and private lives are irrelevant to the public matters. \n\nGiven this, we think the public doesn't have the justification to have access to private lives because whatever these politicians do in private is absolutely irrelevant to the actions of politicians do in public. Given this, we say the privacy outweighs authority of media.\n\nMy second argument is that this is going to be bad for political discourse. What does this mean and why is this the case? Because first, we would have two reasons. \n\nFirst is because we think that there are many instances where politicians want to keep something secret to maintain fairness. What does this mean? Because we think that the world we're going to see if media reports on the private lives of politicians is that if a politician is trying to gain votes, despite being very fair and equal, what's going to happen is that if they're found to be homosexual, they're going to lose votes in very conservative communities. We think this is bad because we think that we're going to have fair politicians being kicked out of office just by some racial bias. We think that those kind of issues are unjustified for the sake of political discourse. \n\nWe think that politicians should have a right to act in a good public sphere. And we think that what their own self-identity shouldn't be bashed out for the sake of the public. \n\nBut secondly, is that politics is going to be a dirty game. That is, the politician is just not really going to care about the policies they make, but rather just try to make a good persona and a personality for the sake of the state. \n\nAnd but secondly, what's going to happen furthermore is that these politicians are just going to try to throw dirt at other politicians, saying that some politicians committed adultery, even if it's not true, saying that one politician is racist. We think that inherently, politicians should just care about the policies they make and not about that behavior they do in private. \n\nGiven this, we think that this is going to be bad for political discourse because politicians are now going to have an incentive to not care about policies, but rather to just shut down competition for other politicians. Given this, we think politicians have a right to private lives. They're no different from us. We think they should be able to live in peace. I'm very happy to propose."", 1: ""As the opposition side, in the age distinction between personal lives and political lives of positions is becoming unclear and like in the age where government has control over other related institutions. We think that media is the only way to prevent corrections and achieve real democracy. First of all, we'll talk about why it is justified. And secondly, we will talk about how those reports are critical for democracy.\n\nSo first of all, we say that they have talked about the traffic privacy rights for the politicians, but we have several responses.\n\nFirst of all, we say that politicians can always sue media if they feel that media reported something so terrible, but we say that that decision should not be up to the government; whether media should report that information should be decided by courts, not the government itself because the government can always sue, like personal lives and exploit it to protect politicians who are committing corruptions. So we're not completely taking away private privacy rights.\n\nSecond of all, we say that medias have no incentive to disclose personal information of people around politicians because what people are interested in is what politicians do or whether the politicians are morally good or not. So, point you can always like put A or B instead of reporting the real name of my politician's friends or family, or like they can always sue. Instead of reporting the real name of my politician's friends or family, or like they can always put some mosaics on the face of the families of politicians. \n\nWe're saying that those concerns of the government are not going to be real but even if we take the best case of the government's light and say that like media sensationalizes like sexual identity oppositions and like elections are going to be biased, we don't think like that's the reason to support this motion.  For example, already in elections, women are being discriminated, right? Because they put their names. They put their faces. And that's enough for people to know that they're women and they're being discriminated. We don't think this is a unique problem to this reporting personal rights.\n\nAnd moreover, we say if that one politician turned out to be LGBTQ like he might. He or she might lose the votes from non-LGBTQ supporters but he will gain votes from LGBTQ supporters and we don't think this is better for discourse.\n\nMoving on to the second argument, how it is good for democracy. So first of all, I'll start by capitalizing media. The first thing we say amongst the institutions that are able to disclose influence about politicians, for example, such as government itself or police, etc. Media is the most far from government, which means that media is least likely to be controlled by the government, like we can see that like court is already being controlled by government, and it is easy to say that all the other organizations are going to be controlled by the government.\n\nSecond of all, what media point about politicians? Two things, first of all, they report whether they are moral. For example, they might report that the politician is committing DV to his wife or something. Then the people will know that those politicians are not eligible to talk about women's rights in parliament or like in the recent example, we can see that media reported that Mr. Kurokawa went out during quarantine and that can help people know that policymakers don't care about the role point they make.\n\nAnd second of all, they report connections between politicians. For example, like Mr. A and Miss B went out to a secret dinner party at like the western sea. This is something that is doubtful. Of course, politicians themselves will claim this is personal life and this is what the government side has said. But how like you don't know when like those personal dinner parties turn into political like corrupting meeting, right? So it is in so-called personal meetings that all the connections begin. So like after all, no one can plan a scheme in the official government building, right? So it's likely that politicians are exploiting world personal lives to actually do corruptions.\n\nSo what is it is like in the opposition side's world? So first of all, people can know about politicians' corruptions or morality and this is critical for like rational judging and voting because this is important because democracy is about receiving enough necessary information and voting. And we say that those morality of politicians is a critical information for that, because politicians are someone who represents people. \n\nAnd if the politician force people some kind of moral obligation or law and but they themselves don't conform it, we can say that politicians are just enjoying privilege by being politicians. Meaning they're just receiving money and pretending to be helping people and people know that those politicians don't care about people they're responsible. they don't care about what people will suffer or like people will benefit from their policies. If so no one will want to vote for them, right?\n\nBut in the government side as well because no one will disclose the information about morality or corruption people can't know about this and if the government's if this motion is taken the worst thing more worse things gonna happen because the government can always threaten media saying that hey, this is personal lives. Don't report this. So corruption is going to be more income under their world. So therefore we are proud to oppose.\n"", 2: ""Let's be very clear about what this debate is about, because this debate is not about a politician who has raped tens of women, because those are crimes and those are likely to be already prosecuted by the state. We think that the sort of politicians that are likely to be the main context of this debate are the ones who have committed adultery, for instance, or who have hidden the fact that they are homosexual in an extremely conservative area where they have the danger of being beaten up in the street and being the subject to conversion therapy. Those are the people we are protecting in this debate, and those are the people that the opposition, at the start of this debate, have ignored.\n\nSo, I'm going to introduce our third substantive, which is how we increase the quality of political discussion inside the parliament, but before moving on, I have a number of responses to the side of the opposition.\n\nFirstly, the leader of the opposition says that this is justified because governments can, like on our side of the house, governments can redefine what the private life is, to effectively protect politicians who are corrupted. That's not the case, because this debate is not about state preventing media from doing something, because this is a value judgement debate, and this debate should be based on objectively whether or not media should do X, right? So this is clearly out of this debate.\n\nBut then they say, oh, the corruption is going to happen on our side of the house. But the important thing we need to note here is that we don't need to infringe on the privacy of politicians, we don't need to know what they're doing, whether or not they are committing adultery, in order to check what the money for the governmental subsidy to a political party has been used, right? We think that those are the public lives, which the media can legitimately check on the side of the politician, right? So there's always a check and balance system that exists on our side of the house. So clearly, that is out of this debate.\n\nBut then they say, in case of the infringement of privacy for families, we can always have mosaic. First of all, I think we have made this clear from the start of this debate, that media is likely to sensationalize at the point where it is actually beneficial to publish the very private lives of politicians, right? Because this is slippery slope, at the point where media is allowed to report whether or not some individual have committed adultery in the past is the point where they are likely to also publish the picture of them in the prom in high school, for instance. And then this extent goes on and goes on and goes on. So I think that eventually, in the long run, media will no longer have mosaic on your side of the house. But plus, you don't have a fear to say that the media is going to do this.\n\nSecondly, because the fact that people, for instance, in conservative, extremely conservative area, know that this politician is a homosexual, it's not just about that they're going to lose votes, but it's also the question of survival. That is to say that even in the liberal context of the United States, there are 160 cases reported of conversion therapy, which is extremely traumatic for the homosexual individual. \n\nNow, the reason why those politicians hide their own identity in the first place is because they think it's worse for those individuals. So precisely, precisely by that logic, I think that the vast majority of context in this debate is a homosexual individual in conservative area, not in liberal area, because if those individuals are in liberal area, they would have presumably already come out of the closet as the leader of the opposition say that they can get more LGBT votes, right? So precisely for that logic, I think that it's false.\n\nBut then they say, so again, on the weird and coward response that we got from the leader of the opposition about how LGBT candidates can get votes from LGBT individual. This is already responded by two response; conversion therapy plus in conservative area. \n\nBut then they say, oh, this is a critical information for democracy. But they have never explained to us why an immoral politician can't pass a law that criminalizes sexual harassment, if that's what people want, right? The ability for politician to fairly represent the view of individual, view of citizen is independent of whether or not they have committed adultery in the past, right? \n\nI think we can make it very clear, because I think what matters is how those politicians act in the public sphere, which is exactly the information that currently people can assess, right?For instance, I think that it's very clear that the voters have dozens of opportunities to interact with politicians in real life and face-to-face, right? Local community, so for instance, in the United States, politicians approximately spend more than 60% of their working hours going to supporters house and going to community center and interact with the voters, right, in order to get the crucial voter in order to be re-elected in the next election. \n\nSo there are plenty of opportunities for those individuals who are genuinely caring about politics to be able to interact with politicians, thus being able to know about the very minor details of those individuals, right? The distinction we have to draw is that whether or not those politicians have actually consented to this disclosure of information, that is a crucial point we're making in this debate.\n\nBut finally, I want to add one thing to our argument about politics, right? One layer of mechanism as to why media is likely to use this tactic, so debunk the private lives of politicians, of opponents of politicians, actually. For instance, conservative media actively marginalizing liberal side of politicians in order to get the politics to be more conservative, right? \n\nSo why is this a powerful tool for media to effectively marginalize politicians? Because there's a confirmation bias. For example, when a media broadcasts a picture of a politician who advocates to support the poor, wearing the thousand dollar suit in their vacation, for instance, even if that picture was photoshopped, for instance, people are going to effectively and immediately tie that politician with the image of being greedy at the point where that image is planted in people's mind, subconscious mind, is a point where even if that politician says that it's not true, it's a photoshopped picture, it seems like a pathetic attempt for that politician because you are a bad guy from the eye of the public. \n\nSo I think we can all be clear that there are perverse incentives for media organizations, actually, especially conservative media organizations, to actively disenfranchise the liberal side of politicians and vice versa. So I think the politics is not going to focus on the policy and what the good for the society actually is, but more of the personal side of each politician and the image control, and it's going to be a really dirty game. \n\nSo on to first, how it increases the quality of political discussion. I think we made it clear that the premise of this argument is that politicians' ability and how good a politician is at their job is independent from their personal life and how they act in the private sphere. And with that in mind, I think that the competitiveness of the job of politician is likely to increase on our side of the house for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, it's because being a politician, there are already a lot of hurdles on being a politician. For instance, the responsibility that comes with it or potential backlash that you're likely to get. The fact that media actively debunks private lives of politicians means that there will be more disincentive for people not to become politicians. \n\nSecondly, it increases the accessibility of people to become politicians because people who have committed something immoral, maybe, can't be a political candidate immediately in the first place. \n\nSo this increase in competitiveness means that we get politicians who better represent the will of the people. That means we get a far better form of democracy on our side of the house. For that reason, we want to protect the privacy of politicians. We want the politics to be better on our side of the house. Very proud to propose."", 3: ""We believe that the most important thing in politics is preventing collapse by raising the politician's consciousness, and media in itself have rights to report what is related to your public interest and is helpful for citizens to electing politicians.\n\nSo before moving to my argument, I'm going to refute to the government side. So what the government side said is that there is no legislation to report the politician's private life because there is no consent and also includes your family members, but this is not true because under the status quo, media itself does not report your really private life. What the media is doing is, like, because media is not reporting, like, his children go to some surgeon's school or something, or he is dating with someone, media is not reporting such kind of thing because this is not related to the citizen's interest.\n\nAnd what media report is a private thing but relating to the policy to some extent. So, for example, like, some politicians are appealing to certain authority or certain private company members, or like, he or she had a trip in disastrous situations or such kind of thing, but we think people have the right to know because we think that people have the right to know the beginning of corruption, and media have the right to report those kinds of things.\n\nSecond part is that, like, homosexual politicians will be attacked by non-LGBTQ supporters, but we think media will not disclose this kind of really sexual thing because media have never disclosed such kind of thing, and also media will not discriminate those politicians because if media does discriminate because they are LGBTQ, there will be a lot of criticism by citizens, because many people see media and people, there are many people who support LGBTQ, and those people will really criticize those media, and then media lose credit. So media have no incentive to discriminate those kinds of people\n\nAnd even if media disclose those kinds of, report those kinds of points, they earn a lot of supporters, the politicians will earn a lot of supporters. Because for example, under the status quo, Komeito is supported by Soka Gakkai, it is a religious institution, community, but that's why, that's why Komeito have a lot of powers, and what I wanna tell from this example is those who have the same thoughts, or who have the same religious, or who have the same sexual thoughts, will be supported, will be strongly supported by the same group.\n\nSo, moving on to my argument, so first of all, I'm gonna talk about politicians will be conscious, and second of all, media have rights. \n\nSo first, we believe politicians should be the good role model, good, good acting model for citizens, because the politicians should, are elected by citizens, and politicians have to keep the rule, so the voting owns your private life, you make them more conscious about their behavior, also private life reflects your personality, so people are easily understood by citizens, or you'll easily understand their personality, their candidates, or like, their politics, politics personality, larger than government. \n\nFirstly, why knowing personality is important, people are like, because people have to elect, or people have rights to elect politicians, so, because, and, it is, our, really, democracy.\n\n<POI> So, why is interacting with that political candidate from your local voter bloc insufficient, knowing whether or not that person is actually trustworthy for individuals who genuinely want to participate in the world of politics? \n\nBecause what people have to know about their personality, is because then people can decide who he or she is worth of credit, or something.\n\nSo moving on to my speech. So, in government paradigm, people lose the chance to know about those kinds of personality, your personality, and people have, people have rights to know that in order to choose, choose their lawfully person for the parliament, parliamentary.\n\n And second of all, people can know about the faction in each party or know about advocation with certain people or private companies. It is significant because on this data pool, many politicians, some politicians giving money illegally, or prioritizing their friend's company, but this, without media, people can't, people can't know about them, and police will not search this kind of thing because what police do is some accident happens, or some people witness some accident, and then they're going to research.\n\nBut media is not, it's not doing such kind of thing because media will be more flexible to those kinds of things. And in the government paradigm, since the media can't report their private life, citizens will lose the chance to know that, and because media lose incentive to research about that, so politics will be collapsed in government power line.\n\nAnd so in our paradigm, we can achieve, we can stick together who are highly motivated politicians, who are willing to be good model for a person, like keeping those are morally good person. So, so for these reasons, we are happy to propose, thank you."", 4: ""Opposition's stance in saying that the distinction between private and public lives is very unclear is not a substitute and not a justification for the media to be able to report on every single action of politicians. \n\nI'm going to examine two areas of clash. First, does the media have justification? And secondly, I'm going to look at the effects on politics.\n\nFirst, let's look at whether media has justification. And let me number out what opposition really talked about, but it realized in the first place that opposition never really gave a constructive argument, but most of their talk was basically built upon rebuttals to our constructive. So if we mitigate the rebuttals, we say at the moment in which they don't have any constructive impact to fall back on, we say that we should win this debate.\n\nA is that first the problem with what opposition first told us is the distinction between media and government, because there's somehow stance coming from leader of opposition was that, hey, that governments like governments should not be able to report on the private lives of politicians, but media can because media is more reliable than the government. This is an absurd argument to come up with because in terms of authority, governments is the ones that are passing policies that are giving laws that say that these politicians have a right to privacy. So the moment in which opposition is willing to concede that the government doesn't have authority to report on the private lives, and we say similarly, just in terms of authority, the media should similarly not be able to report on private lives.\n\nBut B is that they refuted against our argument saying that these other individuals involved aren't really related because one, we have a mosaic, and two, that media has no incentive to do so. Realize that in the first place, they never refuted our main premise about politicians themselves not giving consent. Opposition needs to engage with this main crux because this was an argument that was a sub nuance of our main argument. They need to say why even if politicians didn't give consent to, why the media is justified in doing so.\n\nBut let's take their best of consent to other individuals. Notice that you're only able to determine whether a politician is, quote, quote, coming from opposition is good or morally a good person, morally capable person, is through interpersonal relationships. That means that you need to know how they behave through their relationships with other people, how they treat other members of society. And in order to find that out, then inevitably you need to report on the private lives of other members that are in the sphere of the private lives of politicians. Given this, we think that these other individuals didn't give consent, and we think the media has no perverse incentive to only look at the politicians themselves.\n\nBut B, notice that when they talk about mosaic, that's not really, that's a really weird stance to take by. Because if their stance was that, hey, the public and private lives is becoming very unclear, so we should be justified in like breaking that apart, then if they're okay with just simply going with mosaic, I don't really see why the media won't be justified in not reporting on mosaic or hiding up names. And I think, rather, if they're saying that security should be maintained to some certain extent, I don't know why it cannot go, why it cannot go to the extent where media should not report on the private lives of any instances. The moment in which you draw an unclear line is the moment in which opposition will still be.\n\nBut lastly, most importantly, is that they said that, hey, this is okay in the case of preventing corruption. This argument is the most absurd but most important thing I want you to know in my speech. That is that I think it's extremely disrespectful to substitute minor cases and categorize all politicians as potentially being corrupt or someone that commits adultery. Because their logic was that, hey, that if no one is looking, then these politicians are going to be able to do whatever they want to do. Look, people won't commit domestic violence just because you have the capability of doing so. We say politicians in general are usually good people who care for society. That's literally the reason why they become politicians, because they want to create policies and make people happy. So it's important to note that opposition's label of all politicians are bad is bad.\n\nBut secondly, this, what they're suggesting as a policy is analogous to, for instance, these people might be committing a crime, so let's invade their house and check. Look, realize that people are proven innocent until guilty, and this is something that is intuitively correct because we can't just suddenly label a person as guilty without evidence. What they are suggesting is in sake of a potential crime, then we should be able to infringe upon privacy, their consent. \n\nAnd we think this is extremely bad because this is going to lead to a slippery slope in a line where the media can do whatever they want to do for some baseless potential of crime. We kept on talking about, and this clashes directly with our arguments about political discourse, because we think it's important that the media should never be able to just do whatever they want to do because of some hypothetical myth that these people have created themselves. \n\nGiven this, media has no justification, but at the moment in which they never engage with their material about how they never gave consent and that they already have a given certain protection in terms of, for instance, like privacy, in terms of bank accounts or house. We think opposition never really was able to engage this. And at this moment, we say the media has never a justification.\n\nBut secondly, let's look at the effects on politics. The first thing that opposition suggested was that, hey, that if we expose the identity of politicians, then they might lose some like supporters from non-LGBT, but they'll gain support from LGBTQ members. I think it is important to note that the media should not be the actor that determines what is good for the politicians, because on our side, we're very happy for politicians to come out and expose their identity if they think it's good for them. \n\nBut we don't think that the media is justified in substituting the politicians' opinions and forcibly exposing the identity, especially in instances of conservative communities, the examples that we told you, because this simply is unjust. I think it is important that opposition is the one that is suggesting that the media should always be the one that determines what politicians want. \n\nI think the politicians should have some certain choice of whether they want to expose their identity of their own.\n\nBut B, is that their characterization of role model. I have two responses. First is that I don't really see the need for politicians becoming role models in the first place, because politicians are not social influencers that determine what kind of people, like the best ideal person that a normal citizen wants to be. Because we think that the inherently job and the point of a politician is to create policies and laws that are good for society. So there's really no need for the general public to have a politician as a role model. And we think that this isn't a justification for the media to report in the first place.\n\nBut B, is that let's take them at their best and that there are individuals that cater, they want to become like these politicians. We think in those instances, that's still capable on our side. Like the POI that Kotaro gave to DLO, that was that we have enough opportunities to engage for these individuals, such as local voting blocs, because you see politicians walking around in the streets and seeing what they are like. I think that's enough of these politicians to act. And I think that that again, is not a substitute for a constructive argument for opposition.\n\nAnd lastly, is the case about corruption. I think it is important to note that we already said in our model that corruption, domestic violence is irrelevant in this debate in the first place, because those are public issues related to criminal law. And it's important that opposition can't really defend these cases because that's simply out of the debate.\n\nLastly, I want you to note the lack of engagement because there was never a response coming to you about how there's going to be worse or politicians and politicians becoming basically a competition of throwing dirt like Trump did to Hillary in elections for Pizzagate. I think it is important to note the politicians are going to be severely worse on their opposition side. I'm very happy to propose."", 5: 'We have a right to watch the politicians behave and are certain whatever that behave is whether that behave is appropriate or not because society always stands on democracy and democracy is also made by electing or supporting by citizens.\n\nI\'m going to move on to the rebuttal. First, the goevrnment side said that ""to report private life of politivians is not justified, because this information is very private, and to judge this so difficult."" but LO defined that the private lives are not like where they live or something. These pieces of information are uncomfortable for us. And in this debate, we talk about more relevant to citizens and police and relevant to policy. And this is also relevant to people. And the people, the people considering got the point of democracy. \n\nAnd this also causes social discourse. I\'m going to talk about this later. And about the LGBT issue. If politicians say discriminative things about LGBTQ, media can report, and this also causes social discourse. \n\nAnd so I\'m going to reconstruction of our side. We have the right to know about government information so that we can make our lives better. And in the election, to change governments, the part of politicians\' behavior, we should know the worst part of politicians\' behavior. If we know about it, we have to restart. We don\'t know that because we can\'t believe him, and we can\'t entrust him with government managing point.\n\nAnd these days, now coronavirus spread all over the world. This situation is very serious, and the government requested them to stay home. But in this situation, if a politician travels somewhere with his or her family, this is personal information, but media should report to us because this is involved with citizens, and citizens can\'t ascertain whether the behavior is appropriate or not. \n\nIn this example, everyone may think that we can\'t trust him and we can\'t entrust him to manage member government. So to report personal life of a politician is also to give social discourse to society. So this is the benefit by taking this motion.\n\nAnd to report personal life of a politician is to give social discourse, and so if we take this motion, we can give social discourse to society. And this also makes there\'s a better government by standing on democracy. So, we shouldn\'t take this motion, thank you.', 6: ""As the leader of the opposition reply, we would like to strongly oppose this motion. Firstly, we will have another look at the constructive matters in the debate. And after that, we will talk about the main clash in this debate.\n\nSo the first thing of construction is why our side's capitalization of politicians is just. So the government side has talked about how to claim that the opposition side is characterizing politicians as bad people. But we don't, but they missed our nuance. Because what we are saying is that politicians are just in the environment that their moral failures can be concealed by governmental power over other institutions. We are not saying that politicians' personal, like principles, personality is corrupt. We think that they are just in the environment that makes politicians' failure invisible.\n\nSo, second of all, they have talked about how discourse is going to be confused. But their argument was weak. Because as the opposition pointed out, media can work both ways. It is wrong to say that media only commit outing or like make sensations in a bad way. \n\nMedia can make sensations in a good way also. As the opposition side can say, media can report offensive statements towards the LGBTQ community or whatsoever. And we say that merely the fact that media can work in a good way is enough to justify the reporting of personal life of politicians. Because in case that media caused bad sensations, then as we have already said, politicians can sue media or something like that. \n\nBut what we hear is like the situations where politicians have complete control over what they make public about their principles and like concealing the biases that they themselves have.\n\nSo, moving on to the main class of today, it is whether like personality can be the criteria of judgment in voting. So, we are weighing the privacy rights of politicians and weighing the rights for the people to know about the personality of the politicians. So, we can compare these two in terms of whether we have an alternative to protect that actor. \n\nWe already said that no one other than media is willing to report about politicians' wealth failures. And the only response we got was that people can interact personally with the politicians. But do you think that politicians will say offensive things in front of their daughters? No. And we don't think also that people are willing to interact with every single politician. \n\nAnd compared to that, in case of privacy rights, we have already shown how we can minimize that harm or how politicians can sue media. That's why our arguments outweigh their arguments. We are more than happy to oppose."", 7: ""What we said from the start of this debate was very simple, right? We don't need to know whether or not politicians have committed adultery in the past, or whether or not they are homosexual, or even this tiny detail of what could tell those politicians stayed in their family trips, right? All of those private informations that politicians do not disclose by themselves are the private information that must be protected on our side of the house.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm going to talk about two things. Firstly, on privacy. Secondly, on democracy.\n\nFirstly, on privacy. The opposition side merely asserted that the people should be able to know without explaining to us why the right to know actually overrides the privacy that we have been talking about in this debate. We told you from the start of this debate, the very tangible harms that come with the intrusion of privacy by media organisations that are critical not only to politicians but also to politicians' families.\n\nNow, there are reasons to believe that the individual's rights and the individual's rights to privacy actually override the right to know. For instance, I think it's clear that the media organisation always gets consent before using any videos in which a person is shot, for instance. You always get explicit consent from the person because those individuals are portrayed, right? This is analogous to what we are talking about in this debate. We think that individuals have the right to privacy, have the right to consent to what extent that information is actually available to the public, and that media absolutely must obey this principle.\n\nThe only response we got from the side of opposition was about the LGBT example. This is practically the only thing that they have revised. They say, but firstly, it's not enough to negate our point.\n\nBut secondly, they tell us that you get votes from LGBT at the point where you say that you're a homosexual individual, you found out that you're a homosexual individual, but then they also say that media won't make offensive comments on being homosexual. \n\nThey completely miss the nuance from our argument, right? We said that this debate, even those individuals actively hide the fact that they're being homosexual means that they're presumably in conservative areas where they have high likelihood of being the subject of conversion therapy or being subject to arbitrary discrimination. Now, the harm is also that arbitrary discrimination, conversion therapy, but also imagine what happens when you are a dear Christian and the person that you have voted for in the last election turned out to be gay that you think is a sin. It's the point where those individuals absolutely go furious with those individuals. We think the amount of backlash those homosexual candidates get is enormous on their side of the house.\n\nMoving on to the democracy point, they said two things. Firstly, about the corruption. This was merely an assertion, but secondly, we have rebutted from the start of this debate that this is an irrelevant thing in this debate and we got no responses.\n\nSecondly, they asked about the right to know. This was again a mere assertion, but secondly, even if politicians are so morally egregious to the extent that they're really bad individuals, I think the fact that in the public sphere, they have not found out that they're morally egregious individuals already shows that in the public sphere, they can control their own behaviour, right?\n\nWhat's important as a politician is not whether or not you're actually a good individual, but rather how you act in the public sphere, how you act when you meet the president of another country. Those are the important skills that politicians must have and the public must be able to assess. All of this information can be accumulated from individuals on our side of the house through interacting with those individuals face-to-face in the community centre if you're particularly interested in politics.\n\nBut let's take them at their best case scenario, which is that the right to know actually exists and right to know completely exists, right? Note that this is contingent on the assumption that the media on their side of the house will equally report private lives of every politician, thus people are fully informed of it. \n\nThat's not possible because we told you in our second argument that presumably liberal media will focus on conservative politicians' private scandal for instance, so there will be a subjective control of information available to the public from the media organisation. So the harm is fairly symmetric even if we take their best case scenario. For all these reasons, please do not intrude the fundamental right that the politician has. Very proud to propose.""}"
