1,The Kansai 2018 R4,TH regrets the dominant narrative of women as non-violent and vulnerable in conflicts and humanitarian crises.,"{0: ""Intention of the Western media, like revealing this dominant narrative regarding the vulnerable women, they don't have the malicious intention, but they rather have good intention in order to save women, save children.\nBut the outcome is different, Mr. Speaker.\nBecause they target, these women are vulnerable, they target these children are so vulnerable that they are weak, they are non-violent.\nThat leads to the bad outcome that ultimately these women and children are being targeted by the terrorists, are being targeted by those post-conflict sexism.\nWe believe that is something horrible, as the Western media has done.\nWe believe, we beg to propose.\n\nI'm going to talk about mainly three things.\nFirstly, how this dominant narrative badly influences post-conflict zone sexism.\nSecondly, how this dominant narrative is badly affecting these women and children regarding these kinds of terrorist attacks.\nThirdly, and lastly, how this dominant narrative leads to unconscious sexism.\n\nFirst thing first, about the dominant narratives.\nWhat we mean by dominant narrative is those, mainly those Western medias, like picturizing these women and children who are being raped, who are being brutally murdered in the conflicts or the humanitarian crisis zones.\nThey picturize those women and children being forced by the power of male, and being forced by the power that they are being raped and they are being weak toward those kinds of attacks.\nThey have the massive incentive to use women and children as a vulnerable and non-violent actor.\nIt's because it's pretty shocking that they are using the picture of women being raped, picture of children being stabbed by the knives or those kinds of things.\nBecause those kinds of shocking pictures and shocking words are going to raise the viewing rate or those kinds of magazines or those kinds of things.\nTherefore, those Western media has a massive incentive to make those kinds of narratives very dominant.\n\nAs a consequence, by this kind of dominant narrative done by Western medias, there will be much more attention toward female victims than the male victims, Mr. Speaker.\nFor example, in Boko Haram, for example, in Syria, for example, in ISIS areas.\nAs a consequence, what happens is that there will be a massive amount of discussion inside of U.S. councils or WTOs or those kinds of more policies sending peacekeeping operations or humanitarian aid toward those kinds of women and children who are dying on the ground inside those kinds of conflict zones.\nWhat happens is that peacekeeping operations and humanitarian aid enter conflict zones and prioritize women and children than the men.\n\nWhat happens is that more male victims are going to increase rather than those kinds of female victims, Mr. Speaker.\nThis leads to the post-conflict sexism, Mr. Speaker.\nWhat do I mean by this?\nIt means that those kinds of male victims who are brutally killed or male victims who are brutally injured by those kinds of war operations, they feel that they need a reward in a post-conflict society.\nThey need some kind of class.\nThey need some kind of money.\nThey need some kind of reward that they have done in conflict zones.\nTherefore, they cannot give away their money or their tax revenues toward women because they think that they were already saved by the Western society.\nThey were already prioritized than our lives in the conflict zones.\n\nWe believe in that kind of scenario, that leads to the post-conflict sexism, Mr. Speaker, that those men are getting a reward and women are getting nothing in return because they have already got those kinds of reward or the treatment during those kinds of conflict zones.\nWe believe, rather, that saving those kinds of women and men equally leads to the betterment of these kinds of situations because those kinds of male victims cannot make the excuse that they were de-prioritized than female victims and therefore they cannot use those kinds of rhetoric.\nWe believe this kind of sexism is going to better off on our side of the house.\n\nSecondly, Mr. Speaker, those kinds of dominant narratives lead to more targeting women and children by the terrorist attacks.\nWhy is that?\nIt's because those kinds of terrorists, for example, ISIS, knows that Western media uses female and children as a news title or those kinds of eccentric news reports.\nTherefore, they have a massive incentive to spread their political messages throughout those kinds of news outlets, which means that by targeting women and children, they will have a massive potential or possibility to make their political messages throughout those kinds of Western media.\nBecause they know that Western media have an incentive to use and target those female victims' reports or the children victims' reports.\n\nTherefore, what those kinds of Western media is doing is the opposite of their aim, Mr. Speaker.\nThey are trying to target those women and children and prioritize their lives, but what they are doing is the opposite.\nThey are rather giving those kinds of opportunities for those terrorist groups to attack these women and children.\nWe believe that is morally horrible.\n\nThirdly and lastly, why this dominant narrative leads to unconscious sexism.\nDominant narrative regarding women who are pictured as weak and non-violent actors is like 100,000 women who were brutally killed and raped.\nThey were forced by men's power.\nThey were overly done by Western media and that leads to unconscious sexism.\n\n<POI>So why is this bit of more sexism more important than the increased amount of aid or aid going to people who actually need it?\n\nBecause, Mr. Speaker, first of all, we want to question why do you prioritize women's lives over the male, right?\nWe could see why that is justified in the first place, but second of all, we do not want, by equalizing those kinds of aids and treatments, we believe that the post-conflict society is going to be better off, right, better off, Mr. Speaker, because sexism is something really rooted in the society and that is going to give less rights to women, Mr. Speaker.\nWe believe that is important as well.\n\nSo by picturizing women as weak and non-violent actors, that is going to make people unconsciously sexist toward women.\nThey are going to say that because you are weak, you cannot wear slutty clothes, you are going to be raped in the town, you cannot wear those kinds of slutty clothes because you are weak, right?\nThose kinds of narratives are going to be dominant and that is going to lessen women's rights and freedom."", 1: ""Okay, two issues from leader position.\nFirstly, I will talk about the realistic characterization of women in conflict.\nWe do recognize that some women are strong, who are capable enough to fight back against men.\nBut unfortunate reality is that in general, women are likely to be comparatively more vulnerable than men,\nand comparatively more likely to target the atrocious consequences.\nThus, they need more support and protection.\n\nSecondly, I will talk about why, due to the dominant narrative,\nthey uniquely make it possible for us and surroundings or NGOs or donors\nto provide the necessary support and a decent amount of support\nso that their women are going to be protected.\n\nBefore that, I will present the responses to the Prime Minister.\nFirstly, they said that this dominant narrative incentivized terrorists to exclusively target women in the conflict areas.\nFirstly, we do concede that the status quo is not perfect,\nbut we think that due to this narrative, the situation is currently going to be changed.\nFor example, the International Criminal Court actually introduced the rape or sexual assault as crimes against humanity,\nand the international recognition that sexual assault requires special recognition.\nAnd also, there is a certain international criminal bashing towards the ignorance of the government\nwho has an incompatibility to deal with sexual assault.\n\nBut furthermore, when it comes to the media's emphasis on gaining attention,\nwe see that terrorist groups are also already relying on the other kind of things.\nFor example, they are relying on the suicidal attack, or they are relying on the indiscriminate killing,\nand this is even more attracting when it comes to getting attention through the media.\nSo I don't think this is a core motive for terrorist groups to exclusively target women on the ground.\n\nThey said that male protection is going to be on the mind, compared to the female.\nBut as I explained earlier, we think that given that women are likely to need special protection,\nwe think it's proportionate and we think it's good.\n\nLastly, they said that this dominant narrative is leading to the post-conflict system.\nBut we think that if those kinds of leaders or men in society have the intention to discriminate women,\nwe think that they are going to anyway find any excuse to discriminate women or let's reward women on the ground.\nMaybe, for example, they may say that due to their pregnancy, women cannot, unfortunately,\nwork exactly the same as men or so forth.\nAnyway, sexists are going to find that kind of excuse and discriminate women.\n\nBut furthermore, even in that case, we have to be comparative.\nWhile it's also a kind of social position of the post-conflict society,\nit's kind of more important than the immediate help of the women in the conflict zone.\nWe think it's more important.\n\nSo I'll just talk about the realistic characterization of the women in the conflict.\nSo in general, women are fortunately likely to be comparatively more valuable than men for several reasons.\nFirstly, physically, women are kind of likely to be weaker or less physically capable to fight back exactly the same level as men.\nIt's just that women are likely to be the target of the conflict.\nBut furthermore, we believe that women are exclusively likely to be the target of sexual assault on the ground.\nWe do recognize that men also can be the victim of sexual assault.\nBut we think the rate is disproportionately higher on the male and female.\nIf we look at the reality, for example, we come to the abduction by the terrorist group like Kohara.\n\nMost of the victims, the abductors, are teenage girls in the school, and they are abducted by the terrorist group.\nSo we think in the realistic context, those who are an individual, women are more likely to be the target.\nWe think they need special protection.\nBut furthermore, maybe the need for sanitary protection due to the biological feature.\nMaybe, for example, there is a pregnant mother who needs much more protection, who is more vulnerable, etc.\nSo we think that realistically, women are likely to be relatively more vulnerable, thus they need special protection and support.\n\nSo given the nature, let's look at the second issue about why the dominant narrative is necessary in order to protect these women on the ground.\nSo we think, firstly, that the dominant narrative allows the point of peacekeeping operation, intervening military or any other individual, etc.\nto provide more support to the women on the ground.\nMaybe, for example, we come to this shelter, which has a lot of women.\nMaybe we can deploy more soldiers so that we are able to protect them more.\nOr, for example, we are giving extra support, medical support or sanitary support to pregnant women, etc.\nAnd also extra support is going to be available on our side of the house.\nAnd also, as I already told you, ICC's recognition of rape or sexual assault as a crime against humanity\nare also introduced due to this dominant narrative that recognizes that women are relatively more vulnerable on the ground.\nAnd we think it's beneficial.\n\nSecondly, we think that this dominant narrative allows the...\nWhat is the connection between ICC recognizing sexual rape as assault and making people believe that women are non-violent?\nThis is because, due to the dominant narrative, people in the liberal democracy can't stand women are more likely to be victimized than any other assault in Korea, etc. No thank you.\nSo we think, yeah, that's really important to say that.\n\nBut secondly, we think that due to this dominant narrative, it kind of enables the individual donors in the liberal democracy or the advanced nation\nto think about the women, the situation of the women on the ground, and think about what kind of support they are going to need, etc.\nAnd we think it's critically important, right?\nBecause the majority of the average citizen in the liberal democracy haven't experienced the situation of the conflict that much,\nand it's kind of hard for individuals to imagine what kind of support they are going to need, etc.\n\nAnd we think that the dominant narrative allows those average citizens or individuals who can be the potential donors to the NGO\nor the supporter towards the women on the ground, right?\n\nAnd they are going to think that, you know, that women may need, for example, certain special, like, sanitary protection,\nor maybe can't, like, want to need extra protection, extra, like, deployment to the military due to the high tendency of sexual assault.\nAnd we think that it's also the recognition of what, like, understanding of the exact necessity of support is very important, right?\nBecause in order to, like, maximize the utility or, like, benefit from the support and the donation,\nwe think that this, like, dominant narrative is critically important.\n\nSo overall, we think that, you know, given that it's, like, unfortunately that women are more likely to be vulnerable and targeted at a special time,\nwe think that it's, like, beneficial and reasonable to use the dominant narrative to gather support and help them."", 2: ""The opposite side claims that without this dominant narrative that women are non-violent in conflict zones.\nWe are not able to attract the media's attention, the western's attention, and the NGOs in the west are not going to be able to protect the people who are suffering in conflict zones.\nBut we reject this analysis.\nWe think that there's a lot of people who are suffering in those conflict zones who are not women.\n\nFor example, maybe men's child therapy, their hands, because of this really aggressive guerrilla groups.\nWe think those kind of images can actually shock people and feel that there's a necessity to actually reach out and protect them.\nWe don't think that that dominant narrative of women suffering is something that's necessary.\nThere's a lot of children who are suffering, men suffering, and also women.\n\nWe think that we can't have women suffering, but we just can't have all kinds of people just show that all kinds of people are suffering.\nWe think that in itself is something that is not.\nWe think that this kind of image that we are creating, that women are weak, women are vulnerable, actually makes women unable to actually fight back.\nNot only during the conflict zone, not only during the conflict zone, but also after the conflict zone.\n\nAnd we think we are making the women in a weaker position, so that is why we are very happy to propose this motion.\nSo I'm going to maybe talk about two things.\nFirst, I'm going to talk about why it is still going to go to those kind of conflict zones.\nAnd secondly, I'm going to talk about which is better for the female.\n\nBut before moving on to my points, I have a refutation to their side of the house.\nSo the leader of the option refuted to my partner that men will always make an excuse to actually exploit women.\nBut we think that may be true, but if there's less excuses, that means that there are less reasons that they can justify their actions.\n\nSo we think that if there are less excuses, for example, women can fight back and say that that is not right because I also contributed to the society.\nI also fought back.\nI also contributed during the conflict zone, so I should have the right to decide on my political will.\nI should have the right to decide to go outside because I can actually protect myself.\n\nSo first, I want to talk about why aid is still going to go in those kind of conflicts.\nSo even if there's not a dominant narrative, that women are not violent and vulnerable.\nSo we were talking about like, so they talked about we have to show images that women are getting raped, that women are getting, like for example, there's need to dominate narratives of women being harmed and raped or those kind of things.\n\nBut we think that in places where in conflict zone, we think that not only women are suffering of getting raped.\nFor example, in places like in Congo, there are many children and many also men getting killed brutally.\nMaybe they're cut their limbs because they think that cutting limbs would actually make their opponents weaker.\nAnd we think that those kind of brutal images can be shown even in our side of the house.\n\nAnd we think that if media can find other images that are very shocking, they have an incentive to do it.\nSo we think that even if women are not being raped and they don't show a dominant narrative of women being raped, we think that it can also attract the media's attention if some people are actually suffering.\nAnd we think that because there's an overt dominant narrative that women are getting, like for example, suffering, we think that the amount of resources used to save the men or other people are not going to be used.\nAnd we think at the end of the day, we think that the amount of people that can be saved are going to be the same.\n\nWe think on our side, maybe fewer women are saved.\nWe can see to that.\nBut at least maybe more men are going to be saved because of this less dominant narrative.\nAnd we think that in itself is not really a bad thing.\nAnd we don't understand why they want to prioritize women over men.\nWe think all lives are equal.\nAnd if men are maybe more protected, we think that in itself is not really a bad thing.\nAnd we think there are a lot of men who are suffering.\nAnd we think at the end of the day, the number of people who are going to be saved is the same.\n\nSecondly, I want to talk about which is better for the female at the end of the day.\nSo firstly, about during the conflicts.\nSo we think that because we actually internalize this, because NGOs are in the West, actually prioritize protecting women.\nWe think women have less capacity to actually protect themselves.\n\nWhat do I mean by this?\nBecause there is no necessity for women to actually maybe arm themselves because the West is there to protect them.\nAnd because the West thinks that you have to be protected.\nWe think that is why women themselves do not arm themselves.\nThey said that women are vulnerable.\nSo that is why women are not able to protect themselves.\n\nBut we think this narrative in itself actually makes women vulnerable.\nWe think women in itself can actually protect themselves.\nSo if you have a gun, even if your man is much more masculine and has much more physical strength, you can kill that another person.\nSo we think that physical strength in itself is not a matter in this debate.\n\nSo we think that those women can arm themselves.\nAnd when we feel that they are capable to arm themselves, they won't be able to do it.\nBecause this dominant narrative is so strong, they are not able to arm themselves.\nThey think that they are vulnerable.\nThey lose hope and protect themselves.\nAnd that actually leads the women to be targets of, for example, a lot of terrorist groups.\nOr they are getting targets of getting raped.\nWe think this narrative in itself makes women weak.\n\n<POI> Are you saying if this narrative doesn't exist, can you make women suddenly take guns and fight against men and protect themselves?\n\nI'm talking about being comparative.\nI don't think this is an absolute solution.\nBut we have to be comparative.\nThat at least women will feel that, oh, I have to protect myself on my own.\nAnd men will fear that, oh, if I actually attack this woman, maybe I might get killed.\nWe think that people's thinking is going to change.\nAnd we think that women are going to be less targets.\nAnd we also think that there are going to be fewer targets of, for example, Boko Haram or ISIS.\nAnd we think they never actually refused to do that.\n\nAnd secondly, after conflicts.\nI'm going to talk about after conflicts.\nWe think that in the status quo, women are seen as vulnerable individuals.\nAnd they are seen as people who did not contribute during the conflict zone.\nMaybe they did house chores.\nOr maybe they supported it.\nBut they are seen as secondary individuals, second-class citizens.\nBecause there was less contribution.\nAnd because we are seeing that these people are vulnerable and they did not contribute, we are making society can create a norm.\nThe woman is less contributing, so let's get them fewer rights.\n\nAnd we are also sending a message.\nBeing supportive, for example, of the people who are fighting.\nOr doing house chores is also not a good contribution.\nIt's not something that is a significant contribution.\nAnd that makes women much more vulnerable after conflicts.\nAnd we think that in itself is bad for the women.\n\nSo that's why we are very happy."", 3: ""Okay.I'll bring you two new substantives.\nFirst, why the use of a vivid and vulnerable activity to increase attention and material support to areas.\nWhy the piling of the aid and support going to the areas is not the same in two paradigms but it's increased on our side of the house because we have more vulnerable, clear images to the public where people feel more need and sympathy to support these areas.\nSecond, I'll talk about why this dominance of a narrative is important.\nWhy people should be aware of the image of what women actually need.\nWhy that pre-imposed exposure to the idea is necessary for people to, in that chaotic, immediate need to help people, they are able to understand what donation is necessary, what they should act right now.\nFor inexperienced NGOs who go into the area, knowing about the situation is so important.\n\nBefore I go on, a couple of independent rebuttals.\nSo, first, they talk about how, you know, it leads to some sort of sexism because, you know, they're vulnerable or something like that from the Prime Minister.\nThey told us what sort of sexism and action it actually leads to and I think the logic is very blurred.\nAnd also, we have to recognize that, you know, in these areas, or it's universally, helping women and children first as a man is a pride of a man.\n\nIt's seen as a responsibility of a man.\nAlso, in any form of conservative religion, it's seen that it's the responsibility of the man to protect women and children first.\nThat also adds to the fact that they won't see that they are deprioritized or they are being abandoned.\nThey see it as a pride that women are actually given more support.\nThey will actually facilitate to let women go on with it.\nSo, it's wrong for them to say that men are so greedy and go on with it.\nWe think that those men do exist, but they're a minor part of society.\nI think that's a bizarre characterization.\n\nBut also, even if we concede that sexism might happen to a certain scenario, we think that's far less important than people being saved by the fact that they're given sanitary goods.\nThey're saved by the fact that they're given food and clothing or protection from, I think, mosquitoes and things like that.\nSo, it's only possible because they have a substantial amount of aid provided to these people.\nAnd we think that, talking about the larger individuals in that vulnerable situation, this bit of blurred sexism is far less important than that.\n\nThen, they also talk about, from FPM and BPM, that they are seen as vulnerable, so terrorists are likely to more attack them.\nOr men, I like to say that they're weak, so you should obey us or use it as a rhetoric for sexism and things like that.\nFirstly, I think Errol talked about how terrorists don't really care about it, which was not responded.\nBut further, there are plenty of other reasons for terrorist organizations or these men to be sexist on women.\n\nFirstly, there are reasons to say that, you know, for terrorists, they are intuitively weak in the physical sense.\nThey may have greed for sexual desire, so there are other reasons to attack women first, unfortunately, as men, male soldiers.\nOr they simply think that they have the extremist views of, for example, Islamic beliefs that say that they should subordinate women, so they should attack first instead of men.\nOr they might have this strategic interest attacking women groups, this historical know-how as tribes and things like that.\nAnd given the fact that terrorists often don't really care about it, it's that this additional one reason of a narrative doesn't really change their calculus because they already have tens of other reasons to do that.\n\nIf the tens of other reasons don't change their calculus, I don't understand why this bit of a narrative that these terrorist people haven't been exposed to, maybe, has any influence to it.\nAnd even if not, because even if you add it, because there's not much of a difference, the substantial difference is really unclear.\nEven if you make male, like, trying to make it obedient, you know, this sexist belief or preferences of men to go on with it already exists.\nThis bit of narrative that exists in the context also has no clear...\nSorry.\nIt amplifies that narrative, but it's not clear to what extent that's important.\n\nNo, thank you.\nBut also importantly, this narrative, as they set up, is a broadcasting of Western media.\nIt's not about how the narrative forms in the conflict zone, but rather about people around the area.\nNot in the area, but around the world.\nAnd we also think that also proves the fact that the influence they want to suggest is not that huge.\nSure.\n\n<POI>\nSo, why have you told us that these conservative sexism are quite minor, limited to not minor people?\nNow, you're saying that there are lots of conservative sexism does exist, so women won't be able to get out of it.\nWhich is it?\nThere are a lot more conservatives or less conservatives?\n\nI'm saying that if they do exist, it's that it's not going to be rid of a big issue.\nSo, no, we're not saying that they're a majority.\nI don't really get it.\nConnection Between ICC and Dominant Narrative\nThen there's a bit about ICC and things like that.\nWe understand that there's not clear connection between ICC's recognition of rape and vulnerability of women.\nThe thing is that it was necessary for the discussion and investigation of female issues even at core, that we needed social pressure to have women being protected.\nBecause in the past, the PKOs, the reporting, didn't even have a section for gender or women.\nWe didn't really investigate the rape.\nIt was all just about protecting against guerrillas and things like that.\n\nWhy is the use of vivid images so important?\nImportantly, the support to these areas are vital to the survival of people on the ground.\nIt might be aid, it might be interventions, it might be sanctions, but all of this is contingent on the fact that you have a necessary critical mass of people who care about the area, who are angered by the situation and want to support these areas.\nThe more support and attention you have, you have more people saved, or quickly saved because of interventions that were done a bit more quickly.\n\nObviously, the sympathy that is created by the image of the media is enhanced when you use, unfortunately, more vulnerable looking actors.\nThe use of the image of a woman is far more vulnerable looking than a man.\nAlso, religious narratives and social narratives about how men should be obliged to protect women also enhance the fact that when women are put in vulnerable positions compared to men, it provokes some emotional feelings that they should protect them compared to men.\nThey do have the tool of children in their side of the house too, but the mixed use of women would also lead to an accelerated power to have more attention in these areas, and an increased amount of power means that we are able to save these people on the ground more, and that means that more aid is coming around the side of the house.\n\nSo they say that men are going to receive less aid, but if the pie is increased, they don't receive less.\nBut also, even if we can see that men don't receive sufficient aid, it's that men have more energy and have vitality compared to women.\nSo being prioritized in the situation of aid is far less important than women being provided of the actual needs on the ground.\nShortly on why dominant narratives.\n\nUnfortunately, people, when they want to actually help a certain area, they just delay the things that they actually think they need.\nBut the clothing and the food that they actually provide might not be a necessary thing, it might be a burden to the actual area.\nTo prevent that, it's important that people expose the image of what actually women need.\nThe image that women are suffering in this particular way through the media, providing the understanding that the issues are real, the issues are sanitary conditions, you need napkins instead of actual random foods or clothing and things like that.\n\nThat's only possible when the dominant narrative is also public and people are pre-emptively aware of the particular situation.\nInexperienced NGOs also will be able to be aware of the situation and not provide random unnecessary things but actual needy things for women.\nThat's only possible if we can have a narrative and not an alternative systematic approach.\nThank you."", 4: ""This debate is not about whether we are allowed to put this picture as, for example, MSF, like for example Red Cross, showing a picture that women are being brutalized in African countries.\nThis debate is about whether that should be dominant, whether that narrative should be dominant, that everyone believes that it is always a female who are being brutalized.\n\nIt is always a female who are never going to be violent, who are never going to be non-vulnerable.\nWomen are always weak, they cannot do anything by themselves, and that narrative should be dominated within a society and make every person in a society, including the white men in the United States or the female in Africa, to believe that women should be non-violent.\nWe do not think so because that obviously does not reflect the reality, and we think that incentivizes multiple kinds of actors to believe also that women are non-violent and vulnerable, they won't fight back.\n\nWe can utilize and we can exploit the weakness which has been created by the Western media to harm women.\nWe think saying that women are non-violent and vulnerable does not protect women, they are going to be more targeted, they are going to be exploited of the weakness which has been created by media, we think that is wrong, we should go against it to save women.\n\nAre we talking about two things?\nOne, is dominance necessary?\nSecond, what is the effect of this narrative to society, especially in a conflict zone?\nFirstly, so what we have from opposition, a small number of materials, we won't dispute it because we also have a small number of materials.\n\nOne, they told us dominance is necessary because one, it incentivizes ICC to regard sexual rape as a crime, so we should have a discussion that we should also care about it.\nBecause people have further discussion and people have thought deeply about this woman's non-violence or vulnerability, we should include rape as a crime and so forth.\nFirstly, we think that is wrong, still we don't understand this idea or this non-violence or vulnerability leads to rape being regarded as a crime itself.\n\n\nI think the western male already knows, knew in the 1980s and 1990s that women tend to be non-violent and so are the liberal opposition, women tend to be vulnerable compared to men.\nThe reason I think, the more plausible reason is, they have been dismissing this idea of rape is because they have been quite male-centric, they don't care about this female gender in these developing countries right now.\nI think they have been criticized a lot by the NGOs, the female movement, that even though you are saying that as an NGO or ICC that you are going to protect vulnerable, you are not really protecting those female who have been brutalized in the underground.\n\nSecond, they told us from the liberal opposition, the dominance is necessary because you can get more aid, so PKO can get more support.\nFirstly, we already have told you that if the Red Cross needs a picture to incentivize people to donate, this you can have children.\nWhat we heard from DLO is that no, having one child is less better than having children and wives. I don't get it.\nI think having three children for having brutalized booking is tantamount to showing children mothers.\nPeople don't make value judgment or difference on that point.\nIf there are lots of people who are children who have been brutalized for being so horrible, they are going to donate anyway on our side of the house.\n\nSo, let's talk about the impact for the entire population by sending cash.\nWe have told you from the Prime Minister that this actually leads to a post-conflict settlement.\nAnd they told us, one, they're going to find an excuse for the leader of the opposition.\nWhat our policy does is to make people get away and forget about these excuses to begin with.\n\nWe think it is necessary for the Western society to treat male and female quite equally and show the stance that regardless of the vulnerability, we should treat them equally.\nThey are an important source for the countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAnd we think we want those developing countries to follow the values that Western countries have.\nThat's why we think those people are more likely to think that sexism is something unfortunate, sexism is something wrong to have in our society as Western countries have done.\n\nThey told us, next was, no, this conservative does exist anyway, and that's quite minus, right?\nWe want to fix this conservative, moderate conservative, but as a Western country to show the stance that we want to treat those people equally, and you should treat those female and male equally, and forget about this conservative value we have in our society, and that we think more likely the developing countries follow our stance, yes.\n\n<POI>\nSo, here it looks like you regret the broadcasting which only changes stance and regretting of the theoretical dominant situation.\nWhat do you support in comparison of how broadcasting has happened?\nWhat sort of values should exist?\n\nWe want a society where broadcasts kind of become diverse, I guess.\nWe just want to oppose domination itself.\nSo, what we're saying is, maybe if the ones, for example, CNN broadcasts the way women have been brutalized, we're not opposing itself, right?\nWhat we're saying is, the BBC, CNN, Russia Today, whatever, all sorts of media broadcasts that keep repeating the word, it is always the women and children who have been brutalized.\nWe want to avoid dominance itself, right?\nWe're not opposing to the idea of women being brutalized and broadcasting itself, right?\nWe think that may happen, but fine, because that's what this debate requires us to do, right?\nWe want to oppose dominant narrative itself."", 5: ""Mr. Speaker, in order for government side's argument to stand in this debate, they must have proven two things, which actually are badly explained coming from government side.\nFirst thing is, by removing his dominant narrative, women are going to fight against men, and successfully fight against men, and also men are going to hesitate to attack men to some extent, even though it's 100% men will change to some extent.\n\nSecond thing is, without this narrative, women are going to suddenly make contribution in conflicts, and they are admitted as legitimate actors and not recognized as secondary human beings or so forth.\nBut they never substantiated how women are going to contribute to a conflict society, in a conflict situation, and going to be rewarded, for example, after a conflict, even though they told us in so many situations there's already sexist context in their side of the house.\n\nAnd also, I want to clarify what kind of narrative we are supporting from our side of the house.\nBecause government suddenly rejected the narrative they identified from Prime Minister.\n\nFrom Prime Minister, they told us, we are talking about shocking image in broadcasting of Western media, and those kind of shocking image creating dominant narrative that women are vulnerable, women are non-violent, that is a setup coming from Prime Minister.\nThen suddenly government said, it's about theoretical dominant narrative, women are vulnerable, and 100% they go against rape, or those kind of attack, and it's 100% safe for men to rape women, those kind of theoretical narrative from their side of the house.\nI don't think it's realistic, right?\n\nBecause even though we have dominant narrative that women are vulnerable, it's not 100% safe.\nMaybe sometimes women are going against rape, going to fight against men, and sometimes not.\nThat's exactly what we are talking about.\nSo we are arguing how shocking image, or those kind of messed up by MG, or those kind of Western media, is actually beneficial, harmful, for protection of people in need.\nAlso, those kind of depiction is better for post-conflict sexism that Prime Minister has set up recently.\n\nWith that being said, I'll talk about two things in my speech.\nFirst of all, during conflict, this side can better protect people in need, including men.\n\nAnd also, we talked about special care for women.\nBut firstly, it's inconsistent with Prime Minister, because they are saying that rape, women, or those kind of depiction is very effective for Western media to attract audiences in their side of the house.\nAnd also, pragmatically, it's very difficult to differentiate children and women, because in a conflict situation, in many cases, children and women are running to each other, to other safe spaces, and they are detected to each other in their side of the house.\n\nThat's why we think, pragmatically, it's very difficult to differentiate women and children as the bounder walker in their side of the house.\nThat's why, Mr. Speaker, we think our side is even better for men, because total pile of AIDS will increase in our side of the house.\nAnd also, it is going to increase more accessibility for men, because PKO and people in PKO don't say, because you are men, you shouldn't receive this kind of medicine and this kind of support.\n\nAlso, we told you that big narrative is not so important for militants there.\nAnyway, terrorists kill many people.\nAnyway, those kinds of conservative people will kill and rape women.\nBut we told you, at least militants in legitimate entity are carrying it because they recognize a crime against humanity or those things.\n\nThat's why, in a comparative manner, we think that we are trying to, we are successfully helping more women in the outside world.\nSo, above all, their case might be standing in law school level.\nBut after we explain the context and characterization of the situation of people there, their argument wasn't realistic.\nIn most chaotic situations in the world, they don't care about those kinds of human rights.\n\nFrom their side of the house, they said the reason why women are less treated in the post-conflict society was that male victims weren't safe while women are already safe.\nAnd also that men feel they deserve reward or higher rights because they contribute to the ends of conflicts than women.\nBut, Mr. Speaker, regardless of the existence of this narrative, usually women have relatively more difficulty in contributing to the conflict or humanitarian crisis in this military purpose of physical contribution.\n\nBecause just because we remove those kinds of narratives, women are not suddenly going to participate in militaries or not trying to solve the humanitarian crisis in their side of the house.\nSo, which is better?\nIn their side, women are recognized as non-vulnerable and maybe sometimes violent, but they are not contributing to the conflict.\nBut in our side of the house, women have justification not to contribute to the conflict because they are vulnerable, they are physically comparatively weaker.\nThat's why they systematically couldn't contribute to the conflict.\nThat's why, even though they didn't contribute to the conflict, they are not recognized as irresponsible actors or those kind of things.\nWe told you how, right?\n\nAnd also they are saying that in post-conflict society, women are targeted on the street and women at all, not to wear slutty clothes and those kind of things.\nBut we are not talking about those kinds of narratives.\nBecause we are talking about narrative in a conflict, right?\nMaybe when it comes to real society, when it comes to safer places, there are different dominant narratives.\nWomen can do anything that they want.\nWe are talking about the narrative during the conflict situation.\nFor that reason, we think even though logically there is some understanding, we think even though post-conflict female right, we are staying outside the house."", 6: ""Two very simple questions. Is the dominance of the NIDILSC important and better assured?\nSecond, could the dominance be toxic? So, from there, we told you that the dominance of the NIDILSC is important in three variety of ways.\n\nWe firstly told you that it's better for the check and balance of the conflict zone, like we're able to establish the condition of rape in ICC.\nIn similar ways, we have numerous check and balance institutions going on in conflicts and situations of humanitarian crisis.\nMore pressure would lead to better institutions and check and balances of enforcement of those institutions.\n\nTheir response from government was that, you know, it's probably a different reason, probably was male-centric and was able to tackle that.\nBut they don't deny the fact that it was ultimately pressure that changed the situation.\nWhat we told you is not that the reason doesn't matter. We told you that this vulnerability leads to more social pressure to check on the situation of women, and that social pressure collectively moves the government, collectively moves international organisations, collectively moves the United Nations to change conditions.\n\nSecond, we told you that it creates at least more aid. The pie is an exclusive thing, they get less.\nTheir response is that, you know, children are enough to create sympathy, but also people don't care about the oily aid, which my partner dealt with.\nIt's that the combination of children and women are the relative context, and that's why people are more able to sympathise with it.\n\nBut they don't engage with the nuance of the fact that some people might sympathise with children, but you have to recognise some people also increasingly sympathise with women more than children.\nWe are able to grab the minds of these people, which means that we are able to have more people driven to say that they want to send goods to these areas, they want to donate to these areas, and things like that.\nSo children might be sufficient, but they miss out on important individuals and contexts, like feminists or other individuals.\n\nBut also, see, it also lacks a nuance when we tell you that, you know, it's women that are particularly vulnerable because they are associated with sexual bullying, like rape, or gruesome attacks and things like that.\nThat sort of narrative is impossible when you only use children.\nThat is the most tragic and constant, detrimental situation that people don't even imagine, and that's why they want to help the situation.\n\nThey are moved viscerally that they have to help the situation. That is why women are particularly an important tool in showing the vulnerability of the situation, and it simply does us very negative in the attempt to say that it's no different.\nSince they have a unique power, we get more power to provide aid and whether it's a better issue.\nBut we also told you that it's important that we have a better understanding of the conflict situation.\n\nIt's not that you need more firepower to protect against guerrillas, you need charity provisions, you need more protection about privacy, or better allocation of refugees to avoid rape between men attacking women and things like that.\nAnd their response was that, you know, it's the NGOs that have to understand it.\nBut that's not the point. What we're telling you is that these NGOs also might be inexperienced or unaware of what is actually necessary.\n\nWhat is it compared to the substantiated harms that we provided?\nIt's all about sexism, terrorism and things like that.\nWe told you there are a variety of other reasons for that to happen. We don't understand why this scenario was particularly necessary and why it's the strongest thing.\n\nWe also told you that particularly men feel responsibility and pride in the fact that they help women.\nIt would be a shame if they say that women deserve to contribute less and it's okay that we feel wrong for women that they didn't contribute.\nThey feel pride in the fact that they're helping women and going on with it. There was no response to that characterisation.\n\nBut further, there was no response to us saying that this debate, as I said, is about westernised.\nWe are not sure why this conflict on the humanitarian crisis area is looking at BBC or the exposure of Naira in the first place.\nThat's why when they talk about the mindset being changed by the Naira about terrorists or people on the ground, they didn't actually prove the connection."", 7: ""There was a news report showing the video of Syrian child who was drowning in the sea.\nThat kind of video, it was sufficient and efficient enough in order to move public opinion toward acting against the refugee crisis.\nWe believe those pictures or the video of a child or one woman or one man brutally being killed or brutally being injured is something efficient and sufficient enough in order to move public opinion.\n\nTheir word of proof is that Y-dominant narrative of women being exposed in the westernized media is something important in order to gain money, in order to gain donation, in order to gain humanitarian aid, which was never proven from the side negative.\nWe already told you from the deputy prime minister and government that that is not enough to win today's debate because this kind of dominant narrative means that BBC, CNN, those kinds of New York Times, they are always saying that women are being the target, women are being the victims, women being vulnerable, women being non-violent.\nThat is the dominant narrative that they have to prove in today's debate.\n\nSo we gave you two problems from the affirmative.\nFirstly, how the dominant narrative affects female's lives.\nWe told you that they are used as a tool of the terrorist groups.\n\nOpposition told us that terrorists do not depend on such method or tactics.\nFor example, they told us about the suicidal bombing or those kinds of things.\nMr. Speaker, that is only limited to ISIS or those kinds of things.\nBut we already have those kinds of Boko Haram using those kinds of female's lives in order to send those kinds of political messages.\nWe believe those kinds of examples do not make them win this point.\n\nBut secondly, we told you that the dominant narrative creates sexism in post-conflict society.\nDeputy leader of the opposition said that men do not do such kind of sexist actions because they have a duty to protect women.\nBut Mr. Speaker from the leader of the opposition, he said that they are going to create another excuse in order to continue doing those kinds of sexist actions.\nWell, there is a contradiction in those kinds of characterizations of the conservative males.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Speaker, they could not prove why these post-conflict sexism do not happen in post-conflict society.\nThey could not prove those kinds of points.\nTherefore, given that, opposition told us that the post-conflict sexism is much less important than immediate protection of female's lives.\n\nWell, Mr. Speaker, they are underestimating the power of sexism.\nIt can lead to honor killing.\nIt can lead to stoning.\nIt can lead to the threat of female life, Mr. Speaker.\nWe live in that kind of situation.\nThat is not a mere dichotomy between lives and mere sexism.\n\nThis kind of sexism cannot easily lead to the death or the threatening of female's life rights.\nWe believe that is horrible, right?\nTherefore, Mr. Speaker, what we told you in today's debate is that, one, those kinds of post-conflict sexism is something horrible, something that can threaten female's lives.\nAnd second of all, we told you that the dominant narrative is affecting the current female's rights, the current female's lives.\nThey are making terrorists attack females.\nThey are making terrorists get the records or to get the opportunity to kill females, to rape females in the current status quo.\nWe believe, what they told us, is that not mutually exclusive.\nTheir benefit to gain money and gain more prize and allocate to females is not mutually exclusive.\nThat can be done by children.\nThat can be done by male victims who are brutally killed, brutally injured.\nWe believe they cannot fulfill their burden of proof.\nWe win this debate.""}"
2,The Kansai 2019 R1,THW abolish intoxication defense in criminal cases.,"{0: ""Chair, victims of rape and violent assault have not, for so long, not been compensated because of the intoxication defence. When public officer raped women being drunk, knowing that being drunk actually deprives him of the ability to judge reasonably, he got only three months of suspension from his job. He didn't lose job at all, and he was just released after his sentencing for three months. We think simply that's not enough, and we think intoxication defence is illegitimate as a form of defence. We were very happy to propose this motion today.\n\nI have two things to tell you from my speech. Firstly, how the status quo of intoxication defence exacerbates the violent crimes such as rape, and secondly, why intoxication defence is illegitimate and should be abolished from the perspective of the criminal justice system. But before that, several points of model.\n\nOf course, Mr Speaker, we are very happy to inform how alcohol deprives a person's ability to judge and act reasonably, and we think it goes through the educational processes that we are doing right now. We think that before drinking, he should know that his judgment ability would be probably diminished, and we are very happy to inform for those informations. And we also support rehabilitation centres when you're in prison or whether or not you're in prison or not, you can actually go to a rehabilitation centre if you have that alcohol problem, and you'd be better, you should probably feel the responsibility when we abolish the intoxication defence.\n\nBut the point is, at the point in which you drink, knowing that alcohol causes you a judgment problem, then you will be responsible fully for the action you do during the time of being drunk, right? So having drunk like that, then you'd be more to the first issue, right? So the status quo of intoxication defence exacerbates the violent crimes. So simply, we think the punishment mitigated based on you being drunk, by mitigating this based on being drunk, victims are not inadequately compensated. They feel their damage, and damage isn't really fully compensated. And also, the criminal also don't really regret the problems that they caused during drunk, and they actually end up causing repetitive crime, and we think this possibility will be higher under their paradigm, right? Yes.\n\n<POI> So what if the individual is intoxicated by a side effect of a medicine that they're prescribed? Your cases are just about specific cases of rape which are rape-coaching criminal justice, and does not accommodate the variety of cases of intoxication, right?\n\nAh. I'm not sure if I'll answer that, sorry. So why does this happen, right? Firstly, we think that when you drink, you know that you'll be excused to some extent, right? Just like the public officer who said in the court that I was drunk, I couldn't really control myself, and he lost, he just mitigated his crime, and said this, and only stayed in three months. He knows that he will be excused, and at the point in which you drink and you do some stupid things, you know that you'll be excused, right? \n\nBut secondly, socially also, you seem to be excluded, right? The narrative that surrounds this crime, because you're drunk, you're not that as responsible as other cases, right? We think that's a kind of norm that's created through this system, because the state officially recognizes as a mitigating factor and legitimate cause of defense, right?\n\nSo as a result of that, two harms happen. Firstly, victims are damaged in the court trial, in the process of court trial, when they hear that the offender says, because of alcohol, I wasn't responsible, right? We think that narrative itself that exists in the court is very harmful for victims to enter the court, and we think that's a double jeopardy for these victims. \n\nBut secondly, also, there is a danger of repetitive crime, right? Please note that the drug rape problem has a repetitive tendency, 60 or 70% of repetitive tendency, right? So if it's because of the alcohol, you don't regret your action at all, because you raped the alcohol and not really blaming the actions and your ability to judge, which is resulting in more and more numbers of victims being raped after sentencing and also after sentencing of offenders, and we think this problem has been so long left in, especially in Japanese society and other universities, rape in cultural society, right?\n\nNo, sorry. So we think that's the problem. But more importantly, secondly, why intoxication defense is illegitimate and should be abolished? So we think that this is an illegitimate formal defense that is more bankrupt. So first reason is because, as I stated, right, it's your choice to choose to drink and choose to maybe prescribe the medicine in a situation where you might do something wrong, right? So if you prescribe the medicine, then you should probably stay home for those moments, and probably that is your choice also, right? So meaning that even if you do things while you're being drunk, at the point in which you choose to drink and to actually go into the society knowing that you might be a hanko, we think those persons should be fully responsible for actions, right?\n\nIt's totally different from, for example, insanity defense, where people don't choose to be a mental illness or cannot really control themselves, but it's rather the way that you choose to drink, right? So it allows us probably to drink drunk driving, where you probably drink and you drive and you're punished, right? So even if you have multiple judgments, that doesn't mean that you are not responsible for action. You should be punished equally, right? So why is this important at the end of the day? We think this is because the state has the duty to serve for the bitter-bitter justice for victims, right? Victims don't care why you started drinking or started, you know, you lost your judgment ability because of you being drunk, at the point in which those are the ones who didn't choose to actually, you know, to be raped, for example. And like, we think that's, for that sense, we think intoxication defense is immoral as a defense and should not be really justified and for that reason, I'm very happy to support this."", 1: ""Before we move to my substantive, I have several presentations about our stance. First of all, we are debating on the existence of the concept about intoxication defense. We are not saying sentences for people who have committed a crime when they are drunk should be always mitigated, regardless of context. It's like any other existing defenses, like insanity defense. When perpetrators submit insanity defense as a case to ask for mitigation, there will be careful discussion about whether or not they actually don't have responsibility. If the court believes the application of that defense is good, maybe it should be applied. If the court doesn't think it is, it should not be applied. They cannot simply win this debate by throwing random examples, which sound bad.\n\nSecond of all, we don't oppose regulations to prohibit actions when people are drunk. For example, drunk driving is prohibited. We are supporting that regulation as well. There is an expected consequence of it. That's why we are regulating drunk driving or some other actions when people are drunk, but we will support it. We claim the responsibility to not respect that regulation, but we are saying the consequences of things like being drunk or other substances should be mitigated, compared to other, for example, general murders, general damage to individuals, that's the stance from our side of the house.\n\nSo from the legal approach, I want to talk about two things. First of all, why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense principally, and I will, secondly, deep dive on specific cases why it is not reasonable to abolish intoxication defense in their side of the house. \n\nBefore that, several independent rebuttals to the Prime Minister. First of all, they provided cases about rape repeatedly. I don't say it's completely irrelevant at all. But problems regarding rape cases are now discussed not in the context of intoxication defense but in the issues about, for example, constant or the factor of gravity of sentences for rape are generally very low. Those kinds of issues are consistently discussed in the current context. We say, they are talking about rape is very lightly treated. It's not about this debate. They need to talk about it in other debates.\n\nAnd secondly, they are talking about victims. Victims' rights are unrespected in the status quo. But criminal cases don't respect victims' rights to much extent, unfortunately, as a system. Victims' voices are heard as one evidence to discuss culpability, but victims' demands for sentencing perpetrators cannot be heard already in the status quo. If you want to argue some compensation things for the rape victims, it will be another debate about intoxication defense in civil cases. That will be a completely different debate. Then, also, it's the same for insanity defense. Victims don't care that people have mental illness or so forth. But still, insanity defense is there in order to protect the perpetrator's right and prosecute individual in a fair manner. That's the core principle of the criminal justice system.\n\nSo let's move on to my first point about the principle why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense. So criminal justice consistently puts importance on the responsibility of the prosecuting individual can take in any specific circumstances. First of all, criminal justice system is built on a trust of citizens. Every single individual should feel it's a fair jurisdiction under equality of law. That's why people are obeying the law, people are conforming the law. If people feel it's not fair, I don't have any responsibility for this particular crime. That way criminal justice system cannot work in the first place.\n\nAnd secondly, as a fact, criminal justice deprives the right of an individual to a great extent which requires authority to present undeniable cases saying an individual is responsible for consequences caused by the person without any doubt by the individual. That's why we assume presumption of innocence. In order to protect the right of individual who committed a crime, that's why we put the burden of proof of criminality on the side of prosecutors not on the side of defendants. So that should be consistently working in a status quo. That's why using intoxication defense should stand in our side of the house.\n\nThen let's move on to the specific cases why that should be maintained. So for example, Ms. Speaker, taking alcohol and other intoxicant substances are oftentimes inevitable. For example, when you work as a sales rep for a company, it's really inevitable to go out drinking with customers. It's not limited to alcohol, Ms. Speaker. For example, some general medicines make patients lose consciousness or ability to judge things which they can do in other very ordinary situations. For example, you may receive Tamiflu as a drug for influenza. So in those circumstances, patients don't have any ways to avoid taking those medicines, but they still will use those consciousness or ability to judge things in their side of the house.\n\nBut in their circumstances, when they abolish every single intoxication defense, the people who commit a murder for an individual in very normal circumstances and the people who commit a murder when they take Tamiflu are going to be prosecuted in the same way in their side of the house. That is very helpful in terms of fairness for individuals who don't feel like I'm very untreated compared to the person who murdered without any reasonable reasons. That's why we think that should stand before moving on here.\n\nOkay. Tamiflu is taken in the case of influenza, right? You choose to go aside the beings that are severely ill, and you are pushing the hypothetical very unrealistic case for the case of the complete harm of the influenza. I don't understand your point of information. Taking Tamiflu is also the realm of this debate. We are talking about not only about alcohol, we are talking about any other intoxicated circumstances. They need to defend why people who are under the law need to be prosecuted in the same way compared to other people in ordinary circumstances. \n\nSo why is this analysis important? Because one main reason to distinguish intoxication defense from insanity defense in their side of the house was that a person didn't choose to be in that situation. But in many circumstances, even about alcohol, about other intoxicated circumstances, a person didn't choose to be in that situation. For example, they don't choose to be a sales rep. They don't choose to be going drinking with customers. That will be the order from, for example, the boss. That is not controllable consequences for individuals. That's why they are mainly distinguished that intoxication defense from other defenses are already not standing in their side of the house.\n\nAnd also, we told you, so that's important. And also, we told you, in those circumstances, victims, for example, when customers are punched by those sales reps, don't care whether people are better or not, people are drunk or not. But actually, the responsibility that individuals can take for those consequences is severely different from people who are doing the same thing in ordinary circumstances. We are not saying people should be exempted from any responsibility. There will be sentences anyway in our side of the house. But we say there is a slight difference over that responsibility that individuals can take. That should be affecting the sentences that individuals will receive in our side of the house. For all these reasons, we are very proud to oppose."", 2: ""It was interesting when the leader of the opposition tells us that on his last minute of speech that there are cases when drinking is inevitable. You're being coerced by your boss to drink in order to increase your sales revenue, etcetera. On the other hand, he also told us, look, they're going to be punished anyway. They are sitting in a room where they think they are responsible for the inevitable action ordered by the boss, meaning that it's massively contradictory. They have agreed that there are cases, well, I mean, in their cases specifically, in their favorite cases, that even in the inevitable cases, there are rooms where those people are responsible for their actions. What we argue from our proposition is that their case, what they told us, is not inevitable in any way, but even if they are inevitable, they already made a massive concession by their side that they should take responsibility on the inevitable cases. We don't really understand why. 20% it was boss's fault for me to reduce it, but 80% was, you're coerced, but still it's responsible by yourself. They have to deserve it. We think that is wrong.\n\nI'll talk about two things. I'll talk about, firstly, a brief idea, a rebuttal idea about this. Rape cases, an idea of the main side effect, and secondly, why even in their case, in their favorite, when we talk about this medicine or customer sales, why we think those people are still responsible and should not deserve intoxication defense.\n\nFirstly, what are the cases we're talking about? The first case we have told you that, well, there are the problem of understanding of gender problems, like rape cases, for example.\n\nWhat we've told from the opposition that rape is not only a problem about intoxication defense, but there are other things that are also involved, when we talk about gender biases, etcetera. We don't deny that. Maybe that is a problem we also have to fix. But also, what we have conceded, had a concession from opposition, is that he didn't deny this idea of gender intoxication defense is one part of the big problem that associates by getting a verdict to defend it, or rape, etcetera.\n\nThe problem we have is that there are people who say, well, that person was drunk, so he raped, so he won't deserve punishment. But still, he deserves a less punishment, maybe it's a factor, because it wasn't for himself. When we talk about boss requesting the employees to keep drinking for increasing the sales salary, he said, well, you know, I'm forcing him to drink a lot in order to increase sales revenue. But, you know, partial part of it is something negative, right? Then he's not going to receive a certain less punishment than he actually deserves. We don't think other people should be blamed on that point, right?\n\nWhat we want to blame for those victims, the criminals, is that it was you who knew that drinking a drug could give you a side effect at that point. You should have asked, and you could have asked, a help to other people. You could have asked your mom to lock up the door so you don't have to go outside or keep bullying other people, for example. You could have had help of your mother or grandfather, any other family members, to be with you when you have to go outside to a supermarket to buy a drug, for example.\n\nSo that person can control you when you have used your conscience and may start attacking someone else's, right? There are lots of options that a person could have taken. A person has actually the negligence and said, I'm not going to take any of those options and I'm just going to go out because I want to, right? And I think actually being forgiven a part of it, it was, you know, it was a side effect, right? I couldn't do anything about it. Even though that person could have done a lot of things to prevent that, right? That person didn't do it. We think that person deserves a punishment at that point, yes.\n\n<POI>So your logic was like, people should be punished without any defenses because you made some decision that caused crimes in the end. So why don't you maintain insanity defense because mentally ill people chose to go outside, which caused crimes?\n\nWell, the distinction here is right. This is a huge distinction, right? So when a mentally ill person decided that this person is going to go out, that person, already before going out, does not have a full capability of deciding what's going to happen when they go outside. What are the other viable alternatives that that person could take in order to prevent all the possible harm that could happen, right? That's the distinction, right? Before people become drunk, they're not drunk, right? Obviously, they have certain constants that they control by themselves. That's the distinction between insanity defense or target of people who are mentally ill.\n\nSecond case was, look, other plausible case was the boss is going to force them so they have to drink, right? Firstly, the requirement from the boss is an absolute, right? If you're going to deny, it's not like you're going to be killed, right? There are a couple of options you can take. One worst-case scenario, just quit. Second option, just go to a harassment center or whatever, just claim your boss that you've been coerced to do all this alcohol harassment whatsoever.\n\nWe think that person are more likely to be told, you should not coerce your employees to drink too much, but that person is going to be squished because there are lots of problems that are associated with harassment and compliance that are associated in any other country or Western world democracy, including Japan, that it's a wrong thing to keep doing all this harassment and we should be nice to those employers. We think that very function as well. There are lots of options that a person can take. And moreover, if that's necessary, we think that boss should also be coerced, right, into punishment, etcetera. That person making those employees lose control by the coercive orders, right? There's lots of options that customers or employees can take. Obviously, it was not inevitable. It was your choice.\n\nAnd moreover, that person didn't have to keep drinking forever, right? We have to realize that all these problems often happen when the individual drinks often too much over their capacity that they cannot control anymore, right? They have also had an ability to control how much they drink in the vast majority of cases, but they didn't do that. They have realized, what boss told me to do is I'm just going to drink a far lot more than the capacity I can have in order to create all the problems, right? We think there are lots of cases where those people had a control on their mind, but they didn't choose to, and therefore those people deserve punishment. That's why in any cases, intoxication defense should not be allowed. It was your fault. You deserve punishment. That's all it is."", 3: ""Two clarifications before we move on to the speech. First of all, what they are trying to prove is that they are opposing the entire concept of the intoxication defense itself. So that's the state of the government's side has to need to decide any cases that's why students need not necessarily to consider about the intoxication defense, even if there is a certain possible existence, it's obvious that they cannot control themselves this kind of situation. Rather, they can provide proof as to why students, in any case, need to abolish the concept of this type of defense itself. \n\nThe second point is that we do not rather than have the responsibility to disperse completely any no responsibility about committing a crime. Obviously, we are more than happy to consider the extent, to what extent they cannot control themselves, the understanding of these things, or furthermore, we are more than happy to consider whether or not they can avoid becoming intoxicated or not, to what extent the harassment by the bossy case, or to what extent they can avoid taking medicine, this kind of thing. We are more than happy to also consider this kind of situation. So, that's the clarification. So, I have one question. First of all, whether or not we can have the responsibility to disperse properly becoming intoxicated or not. \n\nBefore moving on, that's two points of response. So, they're talking about, they're consciously talking about that as a student, we cannot make this sense of rape problematic, people are using these defenses, and they're committing again and again. It's obvious that out of the debate, if this rape is problematic, people are actually intentionally committing crime, again and again, and abusing this type of defense. We are more than happy to also consider this situation. So, obviously, these people are abusing all day, and certain consciousness, we are more than happy to punish them. It's obvious that the debate, what the debate is about, we can just allow the people who became intoxicated, the situation, can have the responsibility about their action or not. \n\nFirst of all, they're talking about, the first speaker talking about the rape culture, etc. Two responses here. First of all, fundamentally, it's also nothing to do with us, this motion based on us, it's obviously that defense is at the principle level. Furthermore, we say that the rape culture is obviously related with us, whether or not the court making, particular decision making, or not. So, even if it's a significantyl related to these, and also, after this system, people recognizing that the responsibility or the situation in the toxication, it's rather counterproductive, I think that. Because in such cases those potential criminals may figure out way how to defend themselves by blaming victims. For example, victimes can be thought to know the culture and created the situation and have some responsibility. So, that's rather counterproductive to combtat rape culture. Uh but it's not so much relevant to this motion. But after all, it's counterproductive.\n\nOkay, so, um, okay, moving on to the first issue, my issue, whether or not we can, whether or not these people have a responsibility in the intoxication situation. So, we think that, generally, that these people cannot avoid and cannot control themselves, and actually they are committing a crime, because they are in the situation of intoxication. Two layers of analysis. First of all, before they become intoxicated, whether or not they can choose to become intoxicated or not. So, we think that, because as my partner already told you, it's obviously that it's inevitable to become intoxicated. For example, taking the medicine, or the sudden pressure from the boss's existence. They don't just quit, or just control themselves, etc. \n\nSo, first of all, as I already mentioned, we want to also consider that to what extent this pressure is so huge or not. So, that's why we still recognize that even the power harassment is recognized as sexual harassment, it's problematic. Obviously, some people cannot reject it, some people are forced to do particular actions. So, on that occasion, we also consider that part. \n\nFor example, they talk about that they took the preemptive measure, they do not go outside, etc. Two responses here. First of all, it's from the perspective of the individual who is gradually becoming intoxicated. It's extremely difficult to understand to what extent I am rational, to what extent I am becoming intoxicated, etc. Even taking drugs, or even taking alcohol. So, on that occasion, even still, yes, they believe in that. Maybe I am 30% rational, maybe I do not commit a crime, I do not offend them, this kind of situation. So, on that occasion, it's easy to understand whether I am rational or not, but still, they need to keep their ordinary life. They need to, for example, take drugs, they go to the supermarket, or some situation. So, on that occasion, someone believes, maybe I am not so much, 30% rational, I do not commit a crime, etc. Are they going to do so? Actually, it's obviously not so much easy to take preemptive measures.\n\n<POI>If we pass this activity, don't you think it's more likely, for example, workers can avoid the housemaid, saying that I will never be mitigated, or those people will act more responsibly? \n\nIt's obviously nothing to do with this debate. Because even if the children commit more crimes, they will still be supporting the child's defense over this kind of idea. The obvious thing is that, whether or not people commit a crime or not, it's obviously a different debate as to whether or not we can give a punishment to those people, and whether or not we can consider that in this kind of situation. So, okay. And also, still that they have a certain punishment, a huge punishment in existence, obviously that's workable, as it turns out.\n\nSecond point, about the other day, becoming the intoxication situation. So, as I already mentioned that, whether or not they are intoxicated or not, it's extremely important, that's a big metric. Furthermore, if you want to become intoxicated, you cannot consider that so much. What I mean by this, is that if you become intoxicated, you can understand what is the linkage with your action, and what is the consequence of that. So, for example, just people who drink too much, so, punching something, so they do not understand whether or not it's a damage to this something, or also how to damage themselves, this kind of thing.\n\nSo, people cannot understand what is the consequence of their action. They can easily imagine that. So, that's why we cannot easily put responsibility on those people, because they cannot understand what is their action, and what are the consequences of their action. It's very much the same as child defense, or insanity defense, these kinds of things. So, that's why they do not intentionally commit crimes. They learn how to accidentally commit crimes. It's not easy to think that this is a responsibility of that person. So, what I told you, first of all, this is a debate about to what extent people have a responsibility. First of all, we think that it's not easy to avoid becoming intoxicated. Furthermore, after becoming intoxicated, people cannot control themselves. So, that's why we propose."", 4: ""Chair, what makes this debate apparently difficult for the government is that we must defend a rather sweeping policy of not recognizing any intoxication defense. It might seem that the degree of responsibility differs between intoxicated criminals and non-intoxicated criminals, so it might seem, according to the opposition, that when it comes to deciding on mitigation, this difference of degrees of responsibility should be taken into account, hence intoxication defense, and the opposition might seem to have a very easy debate here. So that's why they didn't deepen their case beyond self-cultural things.\n\nSo the government's burden is to show how this sweeping denial of intoxication defense can be successful, and this burden will be met by how society currently deals with intoxication problems, making individuals informed about the danger of intoxication, and making them capable of making decisions upon that intoxication. The way we as a society view substance intoxication and the way we inform people about it justifies a special case against intoxication defense sweepingly, and that is the point I'm going to summarize in this speech.\n\nSo, unfortunately, I have only one flashpoint, which is obviously how we should recognize the difference of degrees of responsibility between intoxicated and non-intoxicated criminals. So the main point was clear from the leader of the opposition, saying that responsibility should be carefully calculated in case of criminal cases because public trust in the criminal justice system is important, and because rights restrictions should always be carefully justified on a case-by-case basis. So the first response to this general argument is that, this is shallow, I think, but the second response is that if trust matters, then the leader of the opposition's rebuttal to our Prime Minister's point about the victims' interests doesn't stand at all because we generally have doubts on the criminal justice system that continually decreases the terms of imprisonment of criminals just because they were intoxicated at the moment, right? So we think if we are carrying all the public trust in the criminal justice system, we think that comes in favor of our case against this kind of defense.\n\nAnd the second response is against their point about rights restrictions. Any rights restriction should be justified adequately. And we have no disagreement here. This point is, I think, related to a deeper issue that the opposition side presupposed but not explained. Free will or self-control. We say that the degree of responsibility of one's action should be based upon how much reasonable self-control one could have exercised in the process leading to criminal actions, right? So those who lack the ability to act on self-control at any point of that process cannot be punished as harshly as those who are self-controlling. That might be the opposition's case.\n\nAnd now we have to make some differentiation between substance intoxication and non-intoxication. So how does substance intoxication differ from other cases of diminishing responsibility? So the opposition prefers analogies of mental illness or insanity defense, or more specifically, or characteristically for today's opposition, side effects of medicines.\n\nSo firstly, what is characteristic about substance intoxication is that it is necessarily one's own self-controlled choice that one enters the gate to intoxication. So we say that even substance addiction, for example, such as alcoholism and drug addiction, begins from one's choice in the first place. Not only that, the continual substance addiction or the ongoing process of being addicted can be avoided, could have been avoided, by one's own self-controlled choices. For example, going to a cleansing clinic or choosing to be cared by relatives or family members, all these choices could have been made by those individuals. \n\nAnd that choice, or that self-controlled choice, was in the process leading to the final criminal action. Note that this is a normal case of any intoxication criminal actions. So the normal case necessarily involves self-control that is as effective as non-intoxicated defendant's cases. So we think this is the massive difference of substance intoxication from other cases, such as mental illnesses because obviously there is no self-control in the process leading to mental illness and the process leading to crimes based upon mental illnesses.\n\n<POI> If your argument is true, do you oppose the distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes? Sorry? So if the fact that you knew it and you opt into it is all that matters, do you oppose the distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes? \n\nNo, we don't have to make that distinction because... Okay, let's talk about that later. Okay, let's take the preferred cases one by one.\n\nSo this said first, then what about the side effect of medicines? So we think the opposition cannot just throw one possible case of intoxication. They must show that such a case is significantly likely to lead to intoxicated criminal actions that are totally detached from self-control's decision-making. So we think that deep explanation was lacking in the opposition's case despite the fact that they tried to be specific about each case.\n\nSecondly, they said, then what about being forced by bosses to drink? Bassai already responded in his rebuttals, but to put the fundamental point from a criminal policy perspective, we have always warned the public or cautioned the public of the dangers of substance intoxication in our daily practices. For example, we campaign against drug violence. Those campaign posters against drug violence appear time and again in train stations, for example. An anti-drug campaign exists everywhere. Also, Tamifu is already known as dangerous enough to distort your calculation, right? So we have always informed people about the dangers of substance intoxication, and there was a reasonable point at which people could have avoided getting into substance intoxication, and we think that is a good basis for us to judge that these people could have exercised self-control. \n\nAlso, the fact that we abolished intoxication defense will enhance our ability to deal with such problems as forcing and persecution-related problems. The point is that the way society approaches crimes expresses the society's view about how dangerous the token action could be. So the forcing to drink is dangerous, Tamifu is dangerous, and all these evaluations of the opposition's proposed problems do have an impact on how these practices will be calculated upon on a daily basis. And we think these kinds of effects don't exist for mental illness, right? We can't warn people against becoming mentally ill, and we think this is a clear distinction. Enough. We are done."", 5: ""So, it's like three speakers saying the same thing, but it's important once again to note that their verdict is proof that this framework should be abolished. Because we have told you that if there are circumstances in which this could be applied, like in cases where prescribed medicine causes a new side effect because you were not being well that day and you did something terrible. It might be that you have a hard drinking session and you did some terrible thing, but it's kind of a cultural thing, you know, cooperation that was unavoidable for you. \n\nBut even if it's your after-choice and you're just drinking and going on with it, these circumstances, you were not yourself. You were not really remembering it, you don't really think about it, and it's that your culpability is minimized. We were telling you that it might be that in some cases they are really responsible, but there are multiple cases where these people do not take the reasonable culpability as compared to where they were rational and not drinking or not being intoxicated by the substances. \n\nI'm telling you that I think the distinction reasonably exists, this framework should exist. Once again, this circumstantial argument from coming from God, we can deal with them specifically. The question on their side of the house was why they were willing to abolish all circumstances and the circumstances where these individuals were vulnerable were caused into situations because they were telling us that for some minority kind of cases, we were willing to sacrifice other considerations of justice. I don't think that's how justice should work.\n\nThree questions. Firstly, is this policy beneficial or are those benefits justified in taking this policy? Secondly, should the consent on whether you're drunk or not matter in the debate? And thirdly, if I have time, I'll talk about what is important in the criminal justice system. So, rebuttals integrated. \n\nSo, is this policy beneficial or are the benefits justified? So, the main argument is that rape is terrible, we've got to do something, and they're willing to say that rape is so important that they're willing to abolish it if they don't care about the traitor. One, we think that we told you there are numerous alternatives that are equally effective in addressing the situation. We're talking about discussions ongoing about rape culture going on in the criminal justice framework. We're talking about investigations and assessing of situations that are especially in drunk cases being highlighted as Scandinavian nations taking more hard criminal sanctions on rape cases where people are doing active things and trying to get away with it. These discussions are happening and these things are gradually changing. I don't necessarily think that abolishing it would contribute because if you are able to put in specific clauses about drunk cases in rape situations, then they achieve their goal.\n\nSo, the argument is best saying that we should abolish intoxication defense in rape cases and not necessarily supporting the motion. Because if it takes the alternative, you don't have to sacrifice all the alternatives, all the trade-offs that we talked about, and people intoxicated at the time of one's sins and get all their benefits. So, I don't know why they're willing to get the trade-off. \n\nBut even if we concede that they can get the benefit, we argue that criminal justice is about inclusivity and assessing the proportionate situation. So, ultimately, your attempt to prize one specific case for the case for the sake of sacrificing other considerations or other situations is against the basic framework of criminal justice. You're abandoning your attempt to be proportionate and inclusive of a variety of situations that considerations are willing to make. I think that there was no response that was so clear and substantive from leaders of opposition. \n\nBut another even-edged case is that if criminal justice is so distorted by offenses or rapes or patriarchal judges of things, this abolition of intoxication would not probably help because it's still the patriarchal sentiment that is against women and sins going on there. And you cannot abolish that mindset of people, so that this problematic situation is not really solved. \n\nThey also said that victims are offended by the attempts to prove that they're not really guilty and that kind of victim sentiment is something that should matter. We don't think that is important because they have not responded to our leader of opposition to stand up for how victims' emotions are not considered in criminal justice, which is a factual thing. But also importantly, that argument is invalid. If that argument is true, they're saying that people who attempt to lighten their punishment by attempting to prove that they were insane at the situation with insanity defense would also be discussing the victim and that the cause of insanity defense ought to be abolished too. Or poor people attempting to prove that they are poor, they have to do this kind of thing, maybe discussing the victim so they're willing to abolish that. But that's not how they made the principle of distinction. I don't think that's how, obviously, it should work. So while we think that argument, even if it's beneficial, does not justify taking this policy.\n\nSo thank you. The last practical thing they said was that crimes increase, we want deterrence. We think, obviously, it's just that a 10-year sentence might become an 8-year sentence with the existence of this defense. You have the social sanctions and the criminal sanctions that disconnect it. I don't think that deterrence is the main issue of the debate. But also deterrence is just one part of the clause. So if deterrence is important in that specific case, we might increase the punishment. But that is not a reason to abolish a very distinct and independent power clause that exists in the criminal justice system. So I don't know why abolishment makes sense. Sure. \n\n<POI>On to your POI, in your plan and compulsive crimes distinction, the interpretation of crime is willful on the side closer to planned murder, for example. We think the interpretation of crime is akin to willful negligence, if all others are true. \n\nOK, let me deal with that. So, second question. Should the choice of you drinking matter that much? The principle argument coming a bit from Gov is that, you know, you're drunk, you are aware of it, so you should take the responsibility and just face it. That is not really important, because, firstly, I think they had no response to our argument from the leader of our position and the deputy talking about our culpabilities at the core of the criminal justice system, where to the extent that you are trying to impose sanctions on an individual and to the extent that we consider fairness as important, we need a reasonable accusation and grounds that these people are responsible for their acts to impose any punishment on these individuals and why assumption of innocence exists. Obviously, these individuals, because they were not necessarily themselves when they were drunk, they don't remember it, they usually wouldn't do that, which means that the extent that they take responsibility for their acts is decreased and to the extent that even if we agree to that, there's a different parallel reason to consider that they should be decreased of their punishment and why that doesn't really prove any validity in this debate. \n\nBut also importantly, they say that insanity is okay but drunk is bad. We think that's a bad argument. Because, essentially, insanity is not that you are born really mentally vulnerable and you can't think always. The natural reality is that they are mildly mentally ill and are temporarily compulsively doing something and are temporarily rational, or they're not sure about the extent to which they are rational in certain circumstances. Meaning that these people have situations in which they are rational and can take the choice of their thinking about whether they should go into that situation and are aware of the risk that they might go kind of mentally unstable and do these acts and they're not willing to impose on these individuals and understand the distinction.\n\nAnd the last point about planned crime and composite crime, that's important because their argument is technically saying that you're drunk and you chose that, you should take the full responsibility, distinct from other people that are rational. Meaning that, if you opt into it, if you take the risk of it, you should take the responsibility. Meaning that, if you opt into it and knew that you'd opt into a framework of crime, you should take the responsibility of it. And that's technically saying that a well-planned crime, which you opt into fully, and a composite crime, which you're very compulsively opt in, have no distinction and they have not made any justification of that. And I think that doesn't matter and it doesn't make sense to think it's both."", 6: ""So, Chair, let's make this debate very simple, because there are many trivial disputes which are actually not the core of this debate. For example, sales forces can avoid drinking, they can quit, they can sue bosses for harassment. Actually, that's not important, even though that's a case coming from our side of the house. What we need to talk about here is that there are some differences of gravity of responsibility between these sales forces punching someone and clearly conscious people punching someone intentionally.\n\nMaybe it's right, but there will be some differences between people who are drunk and people who are not drunk. They may have succeeded to explain the difference is not that big. Yeah, they could explain that. Maybe the difference is not that big. People chose to be drunk, people chose to avoid drinking, that will be the choice of the individual. That's why maybe the difference is not as big as we told you from the beginning.\n\nBut the thing is, they couldn't prove there should be no differences of treatment for individuals who are drunk and who are never drunk, and who are consciously punching someone. So, maybe that will already show how we won this debate, but I want to talk about some other government's principle, and I want to clarify why we clearly won this debate.\n\nSo, the basic principle coming from their side of the house was that people made a decision to pass the gate that will be connected to crimes, and they are informed of the risk that their action will ultimately lead to some consequences. Okay, let's look at non-toxicated criminals. So, they chose to go outside consciously, they chose to buy a knife consciously, they chose to meet a person they hate consciously, they chose to stab someone, that person consciously, they chose not to call ambulances consciously, everything was conscious in that case.\n\nBut conversely, how about intoxicated individuals? They chose to go outside consciously, they chose to go drinking consciously maybe, but they chose to drink a lot, that will be a conscious choice of individuals. They may be aware of some risk at this point, but they didn't choose to buy a knife, they didn't choose to meet a person that they turned to hate, they didn't choose to stab a knife into a person, maybe they even don't remember everything after they actually went drunk.\n\nSo, intoxicated criminals are still very bad people, that's also a murder, but they should be sentenced according to the responsibility that they should have expected for the risk that could be, the risk that maybe I will kill someone I hate. But those kinds of expected risks are very different from cases where individuals are very conscious, have a clear mind to kill someone, there will be some differences.\n\nThen, let's go back to the bottom group of the outsider house. We are talking about we should maintain the intoxication defense in the outsider house. We are not saying people shouldn't be mitigated in every circumstance. What they have to prove is there should be no kind of intoxication defense, people should be sentenced equally in every circumstance, even though they have some tiny responsibility, compare them between individuals who are very conscious and people who are not conscious, even though they chose to be drunk.\n\nSo, that's why I share a person. So, I think I won this debate already. They couldn't prove there is no any tiny difference between people who chose to drink and who didn't choose to kill someone, and people who are conscious about everything, there will be some differences. That's why that difference should be reflected in the sentences that should be given to individuals because that should be more equal treatment for individuals who are differentiating,  and that will be the most trustable system that we can rely on. For those reasons, I'm very proud to oppose."", 7: ""Thank you, Chair. We believe that there are two main theories that lose their case in this debate. First mistake they have made is that the line they draw on intoxication defense is so blurred to an extent that it sounds almost contradictory. At the point in which, Mizogami-san said, when you're drunk, you don't remember anything, and you are basically a different person. Then why and on what ground you are punishing the person? Because if you think that being drunk is so big of a deal to the extent that you don't remember anything, then probably you should not punish this individual at all. But the important point is that you didn't provide the reason as to why you can punish and then draw the line as to why that's legitimate.\n\nThe second mistake that they have made is that despite the fact that they keep claiming that there are some cases we should consider, they never really prove to us how that case is important to the extent that we should remain this framework. Because the trade-off that they give us is probably like taking Tamifu without guardian, and do you know the consequence of that? And the consequence is what, right? We don't see the impact, and you didn't really ground the impact as to why taking Tamifu and going out and do something, and your punishment is such a culpable thing, and we think that even if we give the trade-off thing, we think we are actually winning this debate.\n\nBut moving on to my issue, which is about is intoxication defense legitimate based on three criteria, I'll talk to you about this in this class, right? But the first reason they have told us is that we should keep this framework itself because citizens' trust is important, and we should be careful about treating individual rights, which is critically rebutted by Dr. Sun saying society now is becoming a hatred, having a hatred to a drinking culture, and this voice is not really heard under the jurisdiction system, and we think that point is dead, right?\n\nBut secondly, more importantly, the criteria about the consequence of you being drunk, you are not really fully informed about the consequence of drinking, right? So that's the point I pointed out in the introduction, where if the result is unexpected, then why the hell you can actually punish this individual at all, right? We think when the point meets you, overgenerous, overly illustrated, the effect of the drinking problem, we think you lose the ground on why you can actually punish this individual.\n\nBut thirdly, more importantly, the point where you are forced by the boss, and therefore you should be mitigated of this crime, right? Then we think it's not the point, anything that can influence you taking action should be a mitigating factor, right? Maybe you didn't choose to be irritated this morning because I have to wake up early, and you didn't choose that, and you kill someone, and you should be mitigated, right? We think anything then should be a mitigating factor, and we think explicitly, we said drinking and taking medicine without a guardian is the thing that you are doing consciously, therefore you should not be granted the mitigations, right? We think for that reason, I'm very happy to propose that.""}"
3,【CJS入門レクチャー①】mixidea高校定期練習【prisonerに選挙権を与えるべきか】,THW allow prisonoers to vote,"{0: ""Thank you very much, Speaker. As long as the prisoners are also a member of the society, it's a totally unjustifiable act by a government to deprive the rights of the board from the prisoner. That's why we are very happy to allow prisoners to vote. Two things to talk about.\n\nFirst of all, I'm going to talk to you about the importance of guaranteeing the right to vote under the title of protection of fundamental human right, even for prisoners. Second of all, I'm going to talk to you about benefits for criminals and also the whole entire society as a whole. Clarification of a simple model. Of course, we are going to allow prisoners to vote if they are qualified to have the right to vote in the real society. For example, in Japan, they are allowed to vote over 18 years old and such kind of things. And we are very happy regardless of what kind of punishment are they and how long they are in the prisons. I don't totally care about that regulation. As long as they are a member of society, as long as they are in the prisons, we are very happy to give the right to vote for those people.\n\nNo, thank you. Moving on to the first point about the importance of protection of the fundamental human right for prisoners. I have two reasons here. First of all, in a very general topic, even prisoners, they already have fundamental human right to begin with. For example, they have, of course, the right to life. For example, they are available to have adequate food. They can have enough amount of sleep. And, of course, there is no worry of torture, right?\n\nThis should be allowed, and there is no prisons to intervene here. And more than that, we actually allow prisoners to have to some extent of the access to society. What does it mean? In terms of the cultural happiness, for example, they have access to know about society well by reading a book or by watching TV or by reading newspaper or something like this. And they, of course, can work in accordance with the real working environment to go back to society easier and to feel that kind of member of the society, right?\n\nThat's why we actually allow prisoners to pursue to some extent of the quality life as well as the right to life under the title of the fundamental human right to very much begin with, right? That's why second of all, the right to vote should be regarded as a fundamental human right. That's why we should recognize this should be given to prisoners as well.\n\nSo what do I mean? For example, even status quo, regardless who you are, such as gender, nationality, generation, income, the right to participate in politics, the right to reflect your opinion in politics is actually allowed to every single people, ladies and gentlemen, because we, of course, recognize the importance of the liberal democratic society to try to catch up every single opinion and to try to decide the priority of the process and the law, ladies and gentlemen, right?\n\nThat's why this should be done regardless of who you are, no matter how many, no matter how prisoners actually committed the crime in the past, right? That's why it is important to represent your opinion and they can finally feel as a member of the society, it should be allowed any point of mention before him.\n\n<POI>Why should criminals like Nicholas Cruz, who shot up dozens of innocent children in Florida, be allowed to vote on gun control? \n\nFirst of all, don't just stick to the extreme opinion to very much begin with. Second of all, even for those people, we should allow them, we should allow the right to voice out your opinion as a member of society, which is same to, for example, the right to publish books to the public. I'm going to explain the analogy a little bit later.\n\nOK, moving on to the second point about that's why we recognize this, the treatment, current treatment to prisoner is kind of the disenfranchisement of the fundamental human right for the prisoners, right? So, like I say in analogy example here.\n\nSo, for example, the right to voice out your opinion is already allowed. And of course, the right to somehow make change other people's opinion is also allowed in the status quo. For example, like, please remember, for example, some of the very bad guy like a serial killer published some of the statement from prison. And this is actually kind of supportive opinion for the criminal. Like, please remember, the Yama Yurien Uematsu Hikoku actually published the statement that kind of the people. There are some people, handicapped people should be terminated. Right. But it is actually allowed to state it and allowed to publicize to society. Right. But this is the point. It is allowed to voice out.\n\nBut it's totally a free choice of every single individual whether or not they're going to take it seriously. And of course, that kind of extreme opinion must be burned out in natural discourses. And it should be this kind of idea should not be taken.\n\nRight. So moving on to the practical benefit for society and criminal. So why it is good for criminal. I have a good point in terms of rehabilitation, because they finally get the incentive to know about the actual society. Right. Because the political party can provide a benefit for them. That's why they have a very happy incentive to know about what kind of current news appears. And they can start reading a book about a political party or, you know, the current affairs and so on by watching TV as well. That's why they can finally understand the common sense of the society, rule, regulation. And in the future, they will be easier to adapt to society with enough adequate ability of the common sense.\n\nSecond of all, in terms of society, it is also good because the political party has a massive incentive to reflect the prisoner's opinion. Right. That's why they can try to identify what kind of benefit they like to get. And they like to solve the prison issues in prison. For example, the very, you know, the not good quality of the prison environment is happening at the moment. Political parties are very happy to fix by presenting a manifest and so on. For example, the financial issue is also the problem at cause and the trigger of the criminal that the political party are very happy to, you know, try to tackle against that."", 1: ""The crux of the government's case was that voting is a fundamental right that should be granted to everyone and to every single person in the world. PM also brought to you that there are going to be benefits to criminals, but also society as well, because there's going to be a way of trying to incentivize these criminals to not commit a crime anymore and that we think that political parties are able to find the middle ground of benefits.\n\nI think that the biggest issue with the Prime Minister was that they neglected the fact that voting is not a fundamental right, but rather a privilege. Why is this true? Because we think that in the vast majority of instances, the voting comes with certain responsibilities and that responsibility is to uphold the law and make sure that you are able to look after what the government wants you to do.\n\nLook, if PM and government side of the bench is trying to promote this idea of fundamental rights, they need to prove to you why we can still kick out and exclude minors and young children from voting. They also need to prove to you that if it's such a fundamental right that it's upholding our sense of dignity, they need to prove to you why we don't allow these young children to vote, or in the case of people like me who come from Korea but don't have a certain nationality. We think that if voting is a fundamental right, they need to be able to explain to you why these people cannot just vote.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to examine one issue in rebuttal first. Given that they haven't absolutely failed in proving their burden upon why voting is a fundamental right, I'm going to talk to you about the pragmatic consequences they talked about. They said that criminals are able to publish books, so given their logic, we should allow prisoners to vote. So, realize that there's a fundamental difference between publishing a book and voting, right?\n\nFirst, we kind of doubt the premise that you can publish a book during your criminal ages, but let's assume you can. Look, the difference of publishing a book is that in the case of publishing a book, you're reflecting the fact of why you had to commit a criminal, and it's showing a sense of guilt in committing a crime, right? This is different from voting, when prisoners try to legitimize their views and agree to more radical changes in the case of catering to politicians, right? I think there's a fundamental difference between publishing books, and we don't think that should be a metric for allowing prisoners to vote.\n\nNow, given that, if they want to say that, then we say the fact that we are already removing certain rights in the case of prisoners because they broke state laws is self-indicative of the fact that this isn't a fundamental right and isn't beneficial to criminals.\n\nI'm going to explain two arguments in my speech. First, why this is principally incorrect. Secondly, why it leads to worse social outcomes. Let's look at the principles first, two layers in this argument. First is as I explained earlier, and this will directly clash with the argument about like what is voting, we think voting is a privilege, and this privilege comes with certain responsibilities and the responsibility to obey the law.\n\nThe fact that you are a prisoner is the act of refusing to obey the law. That means that the state is justified in removing certain rights in order for them to make this kind of certain rehabilitation, right? I think that the fact that you became a prisoner and disregarded the law means that you shouldn't be able to be allowed to benefit from the democratic system that you yourself decided to reject. We think that's a fundamental principle upon which voting should be based on, and in the case of minors, we think that the reason why we don't allow them is that they can't uphold the responsibilities of being part of democratic system, but also that they can't make a rational judgment because they're still young and they haven't completed the proper system of education that the state mandated. That's why voting isn't the fundamental right like PM tried to bring to you. It is a privilege, and we think that the moment the prisoners broke this privilege on their own, they shouldn't be allowed to.\n\nBut secondly, let's look at moral outcomes. We think it is conflicting for prisoners to be allowed to vote on things that literally sent them to jail for. That's why I gave you the example of Nicholas Cruz, right? Because we don't think that school shooters or people who shot people with guns should be allowed to talk about gun control, that rapists shouldn't be able to vote on abortion.\n\nBut let's take government's best case. That is that these kind of examples are extremely, extremely rare, and that in the vast majority of cases, it's like economic crimes like stealing stuff. We think that still the fact that it is principally you are able to vote on the things that sent you to jail isn't something that should be principally correct. For instance, in the case of people stealing stuff, we don't think that there should be policies that allow less punishment for stealing other person's property, right? We don't think that's something morally correct.\n\nNow we think the point of law is to tell people that there's a line you cannot cross, and that fact that you are going to allow prisoners to vote means that you're going to be legitimizing their views, because we think, because just in terms of breaking the law, but also allowing them to vote means that they're legitimizing their own views about school shootings and stealing stuff, because they want people to cater to their own needs. In the case of moral high ground, and judging by the victim's self-reflection upon the fact that they're going to have murderers of their daughters voting on gun control, or how to use knives, we think that we cite as the moral high ground.\n\nBut let's look at worse social outcomes next. Second argument. Will prisoners be able to vote for good? The comparative is that on their side, there's still going to be, these prisoners are still going to be undergoing rehabilitation. That is, the prisoners are more likely to have conflicting ideas about, for instance, their thoughts about drugs or violence and the things that sent them to prison on the first place.\n\nThat's why, presumably, it's still going to be dangerous for their prisoners, for them to be able to vote rationally, right? On our side, in the case that they're rehabilitated and they're able to go out of jail, we think that they're less likely to vote for dangerous things, because it means that the state justifies that they have been able to go through successful rehabilitation.\n\nSecondly, though, we weed out prisoners who face life sentences and death penalty, because on our stance, we're just going to allow anyone who's not, who is able to recover and go out from rehabilitation to vote. That is, in the case of prisoners who face life sentences and death penalty, I think these people are the most people that are likely to be disattached to life. These people are going to vote for radical policies, such as no abortion or legalizing pedophile, because they don't have the responsibility to look after society, because they can't be able to go out in society in the first place.\n\nBut thirdly, let's look at the perspective of those who want to get votes. Two layers. We think that prisoners become easy prey, and this is going to be a block of free voters. \n\nThat means, A, they're going to be bribed with shorter sentences for having to vote, because they're going to take private prisons where there's no authority of the government.\n\nOr B, is that they're just going to cater to prisoners' needs, which is the fact of shorter sentences and less harsh punishments. I think this will rather incentivize these prisoners to feel it is okay to commit crimes, but they're still going to have this fundamental right. Therefore, I think it is unjust for governments to take this motion."", 2: ""We believe that prisoners are the same human beings and have the same rights as other people. We have to respect prisoners' rights, and my first speaker clearly talked about why rights are included in the vote. So we're proud to propose. For today's debate, let me prove two things: why prisoners' opinions are precious for reflection in today's society and the comparison between the government and opposition rights.\n\nBefore I move on to my argument, let me have a clear rebuttal to what the previous speaker was talking about. The previous speaker continuously claimed that the exclusivity of kids and minor people is now given in the status quo, showing that the vote is not everyone's right and that there's a situation excluding rights. But the difference between voters like minor people such as kids and those prisoners is that kids are just under knowledge, right? They're not taught to have a rule of society; they don't know the structure of society. Compared to criminals, criminals have a certain knowledge and fulfill the knowledge to have the right to vote. For example, compulsory education is now finished for criminals in today's status quo.\n\nFurthermore, they said that rationality is a certain criterion we have to take, and we can exclude in those kinds of situations. But, for example, if we have a certain issue of undereducated people, we have a certain question: Should we take those uneducated people just because they can't make rational judgments? The answer is no. We can't take away the right to vote for those kinds of things, and rational judgment is not the only reason to take away the right to vote.\n\n<POI> Okay, so to clarify, you're saying that prisoners are rationally knowledgeable despite the fact that they might have committed crimes and broken the law, potentially taking someone else's right. \n\nSo you're saying that those prisoners are just having a certain cruel thinking, and it should also be excluded. But this is not the debate we're talking about. We're not talking about those situations; we're talking about whether or not those rights are excluded or not, and this debate will be that our side is now including the right, and my first speaker is completely proving why the vote is included, right?\n\nFurthermore, like what the previous speaker was talking about is that it will reduce punishment when prisoners' opinions are reflected. But this is not true; punishment is not the category that will be changing. The category we're trying to support is those criminals' reasoning why they committed the crime and changing the social structure in the status quo.\n\nMoving on to my argument. One, why prisoners' opinions are precious for reflecting in today's society. Let me make a clear analysis of what prisoners are. Prisoners know best why they committed a crime and what the psychological thinking was behind it. So let me take several cases. For example, the cases of robbing. When prisoners commit robbery, the reason is mostly a social or financial problem. So as we see these cases, prisoners are having a problem that the social structure is not fulfilling their needs. To that extent, we can reflect prisoners' opinions that they have a lack of social welfare, and the government can notice what problems are occurring and can contribute to this society.\n\nOther cases are also clear, for example, murder. When murder happens, prisoners can only know why they murdered, what the reason was, and what the issue was. Most of the time, stress is given. So as we take this motion, we can contribute to changing this society and reflecting opinions. The impact of this argument is that the government can't know even if prisoners' investigations and psychological investigations are given. The only one that can know about the consequences and circumstances of prisoners is the prisoners themselves. So it's a beneficial thing to take this debate.\n\nLastly, let me briefly compare between the government and opposition. The opposition keeps talking about the principle of the argument and why this is unjust for taking, but they didn't even talk about what is the certain impact of not taking, and they didn't really extend on that. Our side of the house is clearly talking that we can contribute those opinions to this society and make a world where prisoners and those citizens can live safely. This is the reason why we are opposing."", 3: ""Firstly, if they were, we think that they won't break these kinds of laws of democracy because if they are knowledgeable people, we think that they're going to obey these kinds of laws. That's actually why we think that it is not the problem. It is not the thing they should talk about.\n\nSecondly, they say that by voting, people, the citizens can know what kind of certain policy is going to be reflected. But firstly, we say that voting doesn't mean you can know why criminals committed a crime. It's just voting for a certain policy. We think that it is not going to be a fundamental solution for it. And if you want to know why they committed the crime, we think that we can ask them during these rehabilitation sessions. \n\nAnd secondly, we say that they can voice out, like publishing a book or other things, as they told, right? We think that because of this, if the people, the citizens who are not the prisoners, say that it is right, then they are going to vote for these prisoners. We think that it is going to be a fundamental solution. And we think that because they have these kinds of ways to do it, we think that this is not going to be a justifiable reason. They're going to be privileged to vote in these certain elections. That is actually why we're going to say it is unjust.\n\nMoreover, we say that because these prisoners once harmed our society, we think that this kind of thing is going to be a retribution for these people. Why is it so? Because if you harm the society, you're going to be restricted to some kind of thing, right? As we told you, for example, you're going to be in prison for a certain time. You cannot go out easily from these prisons until you're going to have those rehabilitations. Why is it so? Because we say that rehabilitation should be the time you're going to see your crime, and you're going to say that I did something wrong. \n\nAnd this means that these people are going to move well in order not to be prisoners and not going to have those second-hand crimes, right? We think that these things are going to be a deterrent for these people to commit a new crime or death. That's actually why we're going to say this criminal system and justice system are moving well in the current society.\n\nAlright, moving to our argument. Our argument is very simple. We're going to talk about these politicians' lenient policies that stigmatize these prisoners. What is so? Firstly, we'd like to talk about what politicians are. Politicians are people who are going to think about every people who can vote in these elections because these people want to be elected in these elections. Because if they're not going to be elected, they're going to lose their jobs and salary. And so actually, these people are going to think about every people who are going to vote. \n\nSecondly, we say that the system of democracy is giving one vote to each voter. That's actually why we're going to say that if these politicians can get more votes, this means that these politicians have more possibility that they're going to be elected. That's actually why these politicians are going to think about the individuals. \nTherefore, if there is some kind of new right, for example, in this case, if these prisoners are going to be given a new right to vote, this means that the politicians are going to try to make a policy for these prisoners. And actually, we think that most of these political parties are going to try to increase these rights. And we think that these things are going to happen.\n\nOne, they're going to say that these prisoners have the right, so we're going to reduce the criminal justice system. For example, you're going to abolish death penalty or prevent giving harsh punishment to rapists or other people. Or you're going to reduce these works in the prison or other things. And we think that this means that these deterrents are going to be reduced in these cases. \n\nWhat is the harm? We think that social harm is happening in this case because they're going to have fewer deterrents, less retribution, which means that these secondhand crime or other things are going to increase. And this means that something like crime cases or secondhand crime, juvenile crime, or some kind of specific of these kinds of crimes is going to increase. \n\nSo what is the harm? We say that the stigmatization is going to happen to these prisoners, and it's going to harm these prisoners. What is so? We say that no policies move 100% well. There are some failures. And now, for example, if you're young, you're going to say, because you're young, you do some kind of radical thing or like that. And actually, the stigmatization will happen in these cases.What kind of harm is going to happen? We say that the negative campaign is going to harm more to these prisoners. What is so? Because if you're going to be in the opposition party and you're going to criticize your government.\n\nWe say that the scapegoat that you can use is the prisoners, right? Because the crime is going to increase. You say that, oh, because the government did some kind of these things. We say that there are going to be more and more crimes in the societies or like other things. And the media are going to say these things too. So actually this means that the students are going to be affected and radicalize these things. This is the same case of the Hispanic problem of America or like the refugee problem of EU or like other things. We say that alienized people are going to be affected and stigmatized in these cases. Moreover, because they have something wrong in the past, people have more possibility to be stigmatized. \n\nWhat is the harm? Firstly, we say that there are going to be fewer retributions and rehabilitation because more companies or like other people think that they don't want to accept these people. We say that there are going to be less rehabilitation. \n\nSecondly, we say that the division in society is going to happen. There are going to be more pressure to the societies by defamation or harassment. \n\nThirdly, we say that people are going to vote for this opposition radical party. And this means that politicians are going to take away more rights of the prisoners because they are going to be radicalized. This is actually why we are going to say these harms will happen. Thank you."", 4: ""The world we saw the government draw is a world like this. A world where the murderer of your son can be allowed to shout for gun control, where the rapist of your daughter can vote for abortion, or even someone who stole money from you, which was supposed to be used to treat your mom's cancer, is going to get away scot-free because, according to a member of government, it was a failure of the state. I think as opposition, it's pretty abhorrent to say that people who have broken the law, or potentially even taken lives, or taken someone else's property, and I think it is morally abhorrent to say these kinds of people are knowledgeable and rational, so we can provide them the right to vote, right?I think the moment they decided to not take the side and take the side of victims, we think that we win this debate.\n\nI'm going to examine two issues in this speech, and I'm going to examine the failures of government.First, let's look at the principles, because I think it's pretty clear that they already dropped the point about voting, but I'm going to talk about it. I think the government failed in engaging any points about how prisoners shouldn't be allowed to vote, especially for the things that sent them to jail, right? We think it's pretty weird for them to put prisoners into jails and say, but you can still try to convince us to not do so. We think that's a pretty weak stance for the government to take.\n\nThe only response and engagement we heard throughout this whole debate was that, in the vast majority of instances, people are so poor so they can go to jail, so you can vote. Look, I think that this is extremely disrespectful for all the rational and hardworking people who don't cross the line of the inhumane act of taking someone else's stuff. \n\nAnd even if we take their best-case scenario that these prisoners, like these people who were coerced into committing crimes should vote, then we think they could vote after jail because that's the moment their citizenship is returned and that the state makes sure that they have been properly rehabilitated and they have been able to successfully reintegrate into society.\n\nOn a principle level, it is extremely bad and extremely abhorrent and extremely disrespectful for the government to say that prisoners are really capable actors. I don't know why they decided to side on the side of murderers, but I'm going to go with the stance the government brought to you. Given this, I think that voting is clearly a privilege, that all the people who have contributed to the well-being of society, in the terms of perhaps taxation, who don't make the inhumane judgment of breaking the law or taking someone else's life, those are the people that voting should only be granted to. On a principle level, this is already unjustified, so we say we win this debate.\n\nBut I'm going to examine this debate further and look at the pragmatics, right?Again, the government side was absolutely unable to engage in our point about how there's going to be bribery in private prisons because there's no regulation by the government. We told you the politicians are going to cater to the needs of these criminals, and the fact that they didn't engage any at all and hasn't refuted any of our points is a concession that society is going to be detrimental in the fact that there's going to be policies that cater to these pretty radical ideas of potentially no abortion, for instance. We think this is inhumane for the government to try to defend.\n\nBut let's take the best-case scenario, that was the whole rhetoric about how you need to find a middle ground, and we have to prioritize prisoners. Again, I'm not sure why they're siding with thieves and burglars and murderers and rapists, but let's say that you want to find a middle ground. We think that the way to find a middle ground is not for prisoners to vote on certain policies; it is to literally have a one-on-one talk with them during rehab sessions. So even under the best-best-best-case scenario, it's still possible on our side.\n\nThere was no engagement coming whatsoever from my second speaker talking about how there's going to be stigmatization, there's bad policies. Even if we take the best-case scenario where we prioritize prisoners' needs, we think that that side is achievable on our side. Don't side with murderers."", 5: ""Speaker, have you ever heard such a double standard stance coming from the opposition? Although so many freedoms are actually allowed even in the opposition paradigm, under a third title of respecting the fundamental human right, such a right to voice out your opinion by publishing books, such a right to marry in the prisons, such a right to know about society by watching news, by reading a book, right? \n\nBut why only the right to represent your political opinion should be terminated, should be infringed? I've never heard this exclusive reason from the opposition side. That's why under the title of respecting one of the important rights, we should in exactly the same way as other rights, we should allow prisoners to vote. Two conclusions here. First of all, whether or not prisoners are allowed in terms of a justification issue. Second of all, which can create a better society.\n\nMoving on to the first samples about the justification issue. So I've heard probably some of the reasons why it is not justifiable to give the right to vote for prisoners. So in terms of rationality, right? So they say prisoners are not rational enough because they want to break the law. We should not give the right to vote or something like this. So here are some rebuttals.\n\nNumber one, prisoners actually, my great partner already told you, they already graduated compulsory education here. That's why they already know the fundamental rules of society. We should grant them as they are rational, right? We should recognize them as rational, right? So this is the unconditional right to voting system to very much begin with. That's why. \n\nAnd they say that, what about children? So the difference between children is that who don't really have the right to vote is that, so of course, children have not passed the compulsory education period yet, but those prisoners actually passed the compulsory education period. That's why they should be unconditionally know the fundamental rules. That's what we should recognize them as rational beings.\n\nAnd even if somehow that those people are not rational enough because they are not educated well, that's governmental failure to educate people to implant an appropriate amount of common sense and regulation rule, this kind of academic structure to begin with, right? That's governmental failure to bear the burden. It's unjustifiable to push the entire burden on prisoners to deprive the right to vote to begin with.\n\nAnd second of all, second rebuttal is that, so in terms of rationality, so it is the fact they want to break the law in the past, but it doesn't mean that they are not reflected that past action, right? They have potentially to fully reflect their past action and they have motivation. They have the ability to bring up reflected will to society, right? They at least should consider this kind of other scenario as well.\n\nAnd last of all, so this is the most important argument. So even if somehow they're not rational and rational, this argument doesn't matter. Why is that so? Because it is justifiable, it is not justifiable to ask rationality for acquisition of voting right to begin with, right? \n\nThink about it. For example, in terms of economic policy, who is actually better people who can assess about the economics, future economics? Is it because it's probably the people who already graduated at university and who are educated well, right? But we unconditionally grant the right to vote for every single citizen regardless of the academic background and so forth. That's why the consequential result does not necessarily matter and rationality is not always, of course, matter to begin with, right? That's why fundamentally they should have the right to vote.""}"
4,【HPDU直前追い込み練習!!】mixidea定期高校練習【議会に女性クオータ導入の是非】,THW introduce female quota in parliament.,"{0: ""Being able to say one's opinion is a fundamental right which democratic society must ensure. And this motion is to install a female quota and install female opinions to solve some issues which are exclusive for females.\n\nSo let me first explain our model, which is 50-50. So every voter will select one male candidate and also one female candidate in each selection. And the gender is based on one's acknowledgment. It's not necessarily physical gender. So that is our model.\n\nThe three analyses for status quo. First, females are oppressed in many occasions, especially in issues exclusive to females, which are neglected and ignored in the status quo. For example, child care. They have exclusive possibilities to raise and give birth to children. There are many harms for females that males may not necessarily understand.\n\nOur second analysis is that stereotypes are lessening the opportunity for women to make discourse. The current system is not a true meritocracy, as many means dominate societies and leaders, especially in parliament. Stereotypes portray males as superior to women.\n\n<POI>If your criteria for implementing a quota is oppression and stereotypes, why not introduce quotas for race and ethnic groups?\n\nOkay, so as a stance, we think it is totally irrelevant to this motion. And other like parliament, it can be installed in another case that female quota is for female issues. And if ethnic problems or such things are so serious, it can be introduced. And yeah, that's the stance.\n\nBack to analysis, there is a so-called meritocracy in the status quo, which is not actual. The idea that females can't have enough ability as males is perpetuating stereotypes, limiting opportunities for women to express themselves.\n\nThe third analysis is that there is oppression motivating females to speak up and bring about change. The motion aims to break the unconscious voting based on stereotypes, allowing women to voice their opinions and contribute to societal change.\n\nNow, let me explain the exclusivity of this motion. Two things to say - why other solutions can't solve and why this quota can. In parliament, those who can be candidates can make an opinion and have a chance to change society. The quota ensures exclusive opportunities for women in this crucial role. So, I am so proud to propose."", 1: ""The reason why I gave race and ethnicity as a reason why we don't implement quotas is because we think the fact that just because a certain group is oppressed and has stereotypes against them is not enough of a just reason to do so. Even if it is enough of a just reason to implement quotas, we say that the harms actually are counterintuitive and counterproductive in the liberalization of these minority groups. I'm very happy to oppose.\n\nWhat is our stance as an opposition? We say our side has a stance of trying to achieve the issue of gender equality throughout measures that are not female quotas. That looks like things like engaging in targeted recruiting and trying to increase the number of women who are capable of entering elections. We're going to promote women applying for jobs which are very male-oriented, such as getting into STEM fields. We're also going to ensure fair pay and legislative action for paid leave, for instance. We think that those cases can be done by men and don't need a radical change of female quotas which harms and infringes on the principle of equal opportunity.\n\nThe reason why this stance is so important but also so mutually exclusive on our house is that our side puts equal opportunity, the most fundamental case of democracy which government tried to say their side was supporting. We say that on our side, we make sure the woman with skills can go up the corporate ladder without any kind of bias, whereas in their world, they're automatically letting women into powerful positions. As a stance, we support different things, so if they try to say that all these kinds of things can be achieved on the government side, we say that's going to automatically mean their stance is contradicting because there's a difference between equal opportunity and affirmative action.\n\nWith this in mind, two things come to mind. First, why this is principally unjust and shouldn't be taken in a democratic nation. And secondly, why their side harms women, the very factor they're trying to protect. \n\nPrinciply, this is unjust. We say that the principle of competition, regardless of elections, is equal opportunity. That is that we should ensure always that the one who deserves something should always get rewarded. Two reasons why. First is because this is true, even on governmental levels, is because democracy always ensures that people are able to fight on equal grounds. That's the reason why in many, several cases, regardless of race, for instance, the reason why corporates are able to choose, regardless of affirmative action, is because they always want the people with the most skills.\n\nTwo, the reason why we think female quotas infringe upon this principle is two reasons. First is because it puts the unworthy in worthy positions. As a premise, we cannot assume that just because a woman means that they are able to represent the values of all women. There's going to be women who respect abortions, for instance, while there's women who don't respect abortion. But even further, the fact that we don't, is that we don't think that something determined as a time of birth should be chosen to decide who's going to be the prime minister or some kind of politician in the first place.\n\nBut secondly, this kind of female quotas is something that absolutely discriminates against men, right? You're using a variable that's unchangeable at the time of birth to decide who gets to be in powerful corporate structures. We think that principally this is unjust.\n\nBut thirdly, we say this is bad because it fundamentally attacks the principle of democracy, which government was trying to say they were protecting. Why? Because you now have to make voters have to choose, magically choose a female, even if they don't agree with their kind of beliefs. We think that principally voting should be about voting who you want to choose for. We think that at this point, where you have to make voters select one male and one female, for instance, this goes against this kind of principle of equal opportunity.\n\nSecondly, why does this harm women then? Because we say that stigmatization and oppression are going to, it's going to continue. Why is this? Because in the case of having oppression and stereotypes, we think that even if you get these people into the parliament, they're still going to be just acted as a tokenization for instance, right? That they're going to be, these women are going to be treated as if they were just getting there without any kind of power, but just for the sake of filling up the number of females in the parliament. We think at this case, when tokenization is seen in European nations like France or Spain, we think that this is already true and that oppression and stereotypes are not going to disappear. We see it's going to be much worse.\n\nBut secondly, we see this harms women because this puts women against only women, right? We think that the fairness should be that women and men have an equal ground of fighting against each other, making sure who has the most skill is able to be achieved. But the problem with this is that you're making women go against women trying to get into the quota, but you're also putting men against men. We think this is unjust, but realize that our side does actually the opposite.\n\nWe liberalize and reduce stereotypes for two reasons. First is that we reduce stereotypes by making sure that the most capable people are able to go into politicians by ensuring that there won't be any kind of stereotypes or bias inside these kinds of elections or even in corporate levels. But secondly, we liberalize women because we tell them that they're not being chosen just because of women, but we're choosing them based on their own skill and capability and not a variable determined at the time of birth. We say that our side is much better because we protect the principle of fairness, but also we actually liberalize women, the very factor that government is trying to protect. I'm happy to vote."", 2: ""The leader of the opposition came up and told us it seems to be so equal, seems to be like,  so fair for all the people in the society. However what he meant doesn't mean like,  they are protecting some,  some specific people who are struggling right now.  We say it is especially females who are struggling with their child care but,  but, but like abandoned from the society including, including even like a parallel right.\n\nSo in order to,  in order to solve the,  so the most urgent problem right now in the society, we are more than happy to propose this motion. So with that sense i'd like to,   I would like to do two things in my speech: first making some rebuttals to the previous speaker, second, reinforcing the government cases mainly,  mainly about the practical benefit and the exclusive and the exclusivity like I mean like the uniqueness of this motion to take. So let me go first with rebuttals to the previous speaker.\n\nOkay, so they mentioned about we need to ensure that we need to ensure that like equal relationship with for like between the society and,  like in this motion, it is like female like deep, let's say it is like give and take relationship but even in the even in the government paradigm that kind of relationship still existing right now right because even after taking this motion the female candidates have the responsibility to reply to the to what to the female citizens like to the expectancy of the female like a female citizen because there is a female quota those,  those candidates are, are like elected right, so there is a responsibility for these female representatives to do their best to fight against the issue that that is like existing right now for the female.\n\nAnd second there is also a responsibility for female citizens in general to vote and to make a contribution to the society because there is expectancy from the female quota for these,  for these,  female representatives to do so it must be like,  like important things to incentivize these female citizens to go voting and like to make to create a better society not only for men but but but also for females so that kind of relations still existing right now.\n\nOkay so with that said I'd like to explain first about the practical benefit how this motion can be a solution to reflect the female citizens opinion so we say,  this motion can be a solution mainly by three analysis. First of all female candidates are necessity for the diet or currently right,although our honorable prime minister seems though unlike Mr. Shinzo Abe is highly capable to deal with educational or democratic issue that doesn't that does not mean like they have enough like perspective to,  to care about,  to care about the how these females are in a serious fault right because actually our prime minister do not have children they cannot, they do not, they cannot like make like make,  sympathetic emotion to,  to mothers who,  who are struggling with finding a kindergarten or have to do both working in a child care right?\n\nSo in that occasion that these like that there is a necessity of women of women representatives who came up and,  and like, and, and showed up society that showed up diet to,  to what is like,  like, what is, what really isn't necessary for, for these like, for these mothers right\n\nSecond analysis like  SMS does not say setting I like an ideal stage for female to express their opinion right although there yes there is a social media for women to express,  to express a political opinion or like how they are struggling and they're successful but there is a, there actually is oppressing situation that does not make solution for how those female people are in a serious situation right\n\nAnd then like we say this problem is really urgent problem because,  because we have to we have to protect not only women themselves but also the children of these people right as soon like we have to protect these children as soon as possible because  because otherwise because  they will not be able to make  like  um 100 contribution to the society so it is important to protect these  these female people in the society we are more than happy to propose."", 3: ""First of all, why is there an election? Because the nation can vote and they select the people and the candidates to live their future. And the candidates, after all, are not skilled. Only the female candidates are valued to join the parliament. So is it an equal opportunity? I don't think so. So I will oppose this motion.\n\nFirst of all, I will rebut their argument. This is about a stereotype. However, of course, if there is a stereotype, the people and the nation can vote. So it is not a meaning and it is the nation's responsibility.\n\nSecond, this is about female's role sharing. However, it is not important. So we can't see the necessity of introducing this motion. So how can females change the situation? It is unclear. We can't see the necessity. So I will oppose this motion.\n\nNext, I will explain my point. So my point is about women. I will explain about women.\n\nIn the first place, some of the females don't want this motion. So even if we introduce this motion, some of the cases, some of the burdens will happen. So as the first speaker said, equal opportunity is about skill.\n\nAnd the second is about women's point. So I will explain two types of women. First point is some of the females don't want to do it. Of course, some of the females will be pleased with this motion. Because they can join our parliament, they can get elected. However, some of the people will be unwilling to join it. Because of the government, the women can't join it. So it depends on the government.\n\nSo even if they have a chance to get elected, almost all women don't want to join because of the government's dependence. So almost all people want to appreciate their skill. However, they can't appreciate their skill. So it is very bad for women.\n\nSecond point, second target is like maternities or females who don't desire it. So why is it serious? Because they have to join without forcing. So it is a very bad case. How government decides the rate or desire to join in parliament is unclear and irresistible. So forcing if women don't have it.\n\nAnd after plan, so first target like a skillful woman. Even if it is a woman who is very skillful, it is not a limit like a woman who is very skillful. Women have to do it. It is impossible. So it is a very bad cycle to discuss in parliament. Second target is like they said about women's maternity leave. So they will leave long term. It is bad and the women's image will be decreased if they leave. So I will oppose this motion. Thank you."", 4: ""We say that today's opposition side has a big failure. They never proved that how the situation of the women are going to improve in their side. So we actually think that our side wins because, and principally and practically, because these women are being exploited in society now. We'd like to talk with two things. Firstly, we'd like to do some kind of rebuttals to them. Secondly, we'd like to compare our point with our point, their points, by the principle and practical level.\n\nAlright. So firstly, we'd like to do some rebuttals. Well, right. Well, they said some, well, they say a lot of things. Well, firstly, they said that these kinds of like making some kind of law for women or like other things can be made by these kind of men. But we think that, but we think that the most important thing is that even these people can make these kind of law for the women. Well, some women are actually suffering from these laws. Right. Because it is not their will of having those kinds of laws. They're suffering. So actually, what we think is that principally, we have to make these kind of parliament as a place that each woman and the men are also going to discuss. Their opinion and going to make a better side. You guys ask me what we're going to make, what we want, what we want to make.\n\nAnd secondly, would they point that these kinds of like, is it isn't it good with some kind of like, for example, racial, racial like quotas that we think that. Well, firstly, we think that we can also introduce these kinds of things that even if it's impossible, we still think that we should introduce these female quotas in the diet. Why is it better? Because these are racial quotas. If we introduce it, what would happen is that we are going to like we think that we're going to introduce with the proportional population rate. This means that they're like the parties that only have like one percent of the quota of the minority ethnicity. We think that these kinds of discriminations will be emphasized in these cases because there's only like one percent and nothing will change. We are going to have a more hard time and we don't want to make it. We don't want to make these kinds of situations in the body, but in the world. \n\nWell, as a proportionate population, there are mostly like 50 percent of male and 50 percent of women in this body. Because we say that democracy should be in the small, should be like a small nation to discuss for policy and make a better society without these discriminations. We say that because there are an equal number of females and men, we are male. We say that we can make a better, better discussion, better, better policy by doing it.\n\nAnd moreover, they also say that people should vote for their own will or because it's like a liberal and we can't liberalize women. But actually, we think that the woman is being sacrificed today because we say that people usually win when they vote. They usually see like what kind of experience they have before. If you have like if some politicians are chosen like five times, you're going to you have the high possibility to vote these people rather than the person who had never done these politicians. They ask me why these women are not in politics because women are not that have not been chosen or being sacrificed or being ignored in these elections. We think that these situations are still existing. And to change it, we think that we should give the experiment to these women to change these bodies.\n\nNext, I'd like to go to our comparison of the principle and practical level. All right. So firstly, we'd like to talk about which can work better for democracy principally. Well, firstly, they said that this kind of democracy should be chosen by who you vote or like what party are you going to vote or like that. Then we think that because as we told you, there'd be like democracy. Firstly, it should be a place that you're going to like make a better society by a better society by including the people who are in the country, for example, by using the proportional like proportional rate. Because we say that each of each person should have the right to speak out for it. They ask me why we think that is better. \n\nMoreover, we think that because women are not being chosen, we say that principally it is actually being a discrimination for the woman. Right. We think that this situation is not being improved. We think that it's harmful. But we thought this is actually why we think that we want a principle level. However, we secondly, we want this to be because we actually told you that how we can improve the society practically, because we say that in today's situation, like child care leave or other situations, it's not improving enough. \n\nAnd even you say that something on the SNS, you're going to tell you that you're a Feminazi or like a Twi-Semi or Rati-Semi and you're you're going to be oppressed. Your opinion, if you speak out, they ask me why we say that in order to improve your like status of the social data, for example, like in the in companies or other places, we think that we should introduce these female quotas because they should have better spies on them. Thank you."", 5: ""So, we want to rise female status and we want equal opportunity, right? However, this motion contradicts for this purpose and this motion is not practical. And therefore, we are happy to oppose.\n\nSo, in my speech, let me compare between our alternatives or our points and this motion. So, from two views. First view is meaning. So, government side complains female candidates will be free from stereotype with this motion. However, this motion contradicts from its purpose because this motion itself represents stereotype. In fact, it looks bad on women. So, let me explain. All this motion is saying is that women can't be elected with the help of this motion. \n\nMeaning, after this plan, women are elected not because they are skillful or they deserve to be, but because they are women. So, this motion contradicts from its purpose of freeing women from stereotype. And also, our point is superior because we ensure equal relationship based on equal ground as the first speaker said. In our world, women can work against not only women, but also all candidates based on skill. And in addition to that, government side concedes that our side is better because they did not refute this point.\n\nSo, let me move on to the second point. Second point is the benefit. So, government side claims that this motion can tackle the current problem of female inequality because there will be more female members of the parliament. However, this won't work. So, let's think why there looks no policy for women in the current situation. So, basically, government side misunderstands the current situation. So, why there looks less policy for women is because citizens as voters do not prefer such policy. So, basically, members of parliament are elected through equal vote including women or white, if any, or all people, right? So, this is the basic of democracy, by the way. So, because people have the right to vote equally based on their opinions, this current situation is not because of some stereotype or the problem government claims but it is because of the opinion of citizens as such. \n\n<POI>So, if you say that status quo problem is happening due to the small number of female candidates, how opposition paradigm can solve that kind of issue? \n\nSo, even women or feminists have the right to vote and there's equal opportunity for women candidates. So, if we want some policies for women, we can just vote for such candidates. And also, it's not just women who will have such idea or have such policy, but also men can do so. So, there's no need for this motion.\n\nAnd let me move on. So, also, after this motion, also government assumes that men can't make rational decisions about childcare, as their second speaker says, I recall. This is incorrect because men also have children, right? And they have siblings and families, so they have more than enough incentive to take care of gender issues. So, their argument is meaningless. So, at the end of my speech, let me say that even if you take that they resolve female issues, we shouldn't dismantle the principle of equal opportunity as government conceded. And as we argued, this is what democracy is all about. And we're happy to oppose. Thank you."", 6: ""Even if we introduce this plan and the form of equality realized, this is not the radical solving for equality. Women never want this making up numbers. What they needed is support.\n\nToday's crash point is, which is the real democracy? We have two crash points. And first crash point is, which is real democracy? And second is, which will be a better society for the woman? \n\nFirst, about which is real democracy? They were saying about the women can say one's opinion and also get the seat. And they will be released from oppression. And our point was about forced to choose, which means losing the freedom of choice. Because we have to, every citizen must choose with their real will. And because parliament members represent citizens and politicians who have skill to realize their demand. So, we have to choose with freedom. Choose with freedom is the real democracy. So, we are superior.\n\nAnd about the second crash point, which will be a better society for the woman? They were saying about women's politician knows women's feelings. So, they can protect their problems. However, our point was about they were, we can never say that they are chosen by their real abilities. And this connects to their harm. Because some women don't want to get chosen because of the making up numbers. \n\nAnd also, they will feel pressure because of the government gives them the seat. Because women don't wish this automatic. And also, they are admitting that women are weaker and don't have ability in the society. We can't show that their position is weaker in the society.\n\nOn our government failed in addressing how incapable women who become yes men in the parliament can throw out policies better than capable men who have incentive in resolving gender issues. \n\nOn our side, our stance supports women having the opportunity to fight on equal grounds as men through measures like engaging in targeted recruiting or even not revealing genders of politicians, for instance. We reduce stereotypes because they know that women are capable of entering these STEM fields, for instance. And we reduce oppression because only the capable who are independent can make changes. So, who we want to protect is women who want to get admitted by the society with their true skills. And we are saying about that we have to realize the equality by supporting them, like, for example, promoting getting jobs and giving opportunity. \n\nAnd the second point was about it gives women harm because it's not their real ability and they can't get out of the pressure. So, for these reasons, we are happy to oppose."", 7: ""Two questions in this debate. Firstly, is taking this motion justified? Secondly, is taking this motion beneficial for women? The second question is more important than the first one because in such urgent situations, as the government side has explained, there is no place we made to care about what they call fairness, which was so unclear.\n\nSo moving on to the first question. They have, as we have already responded to the democracy argument, I'll concentrate on fairness. As for this point, their idea was that, look, just leaving women and men just the way it is, is fair. So let's just encourage them, which is a fair way. So then they have to prove that in the status quo, women and men are competing on the same ground, which they didn't prove. Because they proved that in the status quo, the election is unfair. Two things. So we told you how stereotype is in everyone. And so how people, so how women won't run for an election. So women are not even on the same ground. \n\nSecondly, they said that gender cannot be changed. So in elections, we can see profiles, names, photos, and all things are stopping people from fair judge because they are biased. So this beats the analysis on abilities. If they say that people who are capable should be elected, then in the status quo, the capable women are not elected.\n\nSo moving on to the second point, which is, is taking this motion beneficial for women? So women are, in the status quo, unfairly imposed on the government. For example, when the government raised consumption tax to 10%, the government didn't raise the tax of daily products, but then they didn't, they did raise the tax of, like, 3D yohin, which is, for women, a daily product. So why did this happen? Because the men couldn't represent the feelings of women exactly. \n\nAt least on our side, we can solve those kinds of problems, which are the serious problems. And if they say that after the plan is not fair, we still believe that the status quo is more unfair because now women are oppressed, but in this society, everyone has to be equal. So before anything, before everything, people have to be equal. That is the premise for everything, including democracy that the opposition side has been talking about. Also, we explain how we can solve inequality through exclusively zero points, by, like, giving a prize to companies that support women.\n\nSo overall, they said, like, in practical terms, they talk about backlash or stereotype, but these harms are unclear. So are they going to leave when women live unfair lives? And just concentrate on backlash or stereotypes and images. So we think that at least women might receive backlash, but at least on our side, women can get support from the government. So they can work, for example, by having her husband get childcare leave by the government. So we think that is more good for women. \n\nSo overall, the other side's goal was to protect women, but they just concentrated on stereotypes and didn't concentrate on women's practical needs. Therefore, it is clear that we won.""}"
5,【The Kansai 2023 】 Round 1うりぼーA VS APカード【RFD Tota】,THBT western pharmaceutical companies should release their patents during pandemics.,"{0: ""Thank you judges. What we think is very important during the pandemic time is helping as many people as possible and passing those things. In those circumstances, these kind of patents will slow the enhancement of development of new drugs or vaccine or those kind of things, or the accessibility of those things. So we are very happy to propose this motion. \n\nSo two things I'm going to talk about in my speech. Firstly, how patents will bother or slow the enhancement of development and the accessibility of drugs. Secondly, how in our society we will be safe, which is the counter of the status quo. \n\nBut before moving on, I'm going to talk about a couple of models or definitions. First, like Western Pharmaceutical Company. I think, as you know, it's like Pfizer or Moderna, which has a large pharmaceutical company with large money and those things. And what we mean by the release of patents, first of all, the scope of the patents will be more pandemic related. So it is not like all patents, for example, when it is the COVID time, COVID vaccine or drugs that will be. And also in the world where there are patents, you have to pay fee for using that or maybe those kind of companies have to occupy the knowledge, have a right to knowledge. But what we think from the government side, when there are no patents, it is more open those kind of disclosure of the information of the society or those kind of things. \n\nSo moving on to the first argument, how patents will bother the enhancement of development and the accessibility of drugs. \n\nSo at the conclusion, I won't say patents will slow and lessen accessibility for three reasons. Firstly, simply, when there are patents, you cannot get the skill or use that skill because the corporation doesn't have the incentive to share those knowledge. And secondly, you have to sell tons of money to use that patent. For example, if you want to use the patent of the company A, company B has to pay a lot of money, which is unlikely to happen. And thirdly, if there are less types of medicine and when there are, first of all, when there are patents, it means there are less types of medicine. In those circumstances, the prices of the drug or the vaccine will be high. So the conclusion here is that patents will slow the development of the new drugs and lessen the accessibility of drugs. \n\nSo why is this problematic? For two reasons. Firstly, when there are pandemics, these kind of poor people cannot access the drug or the vaccine. Maybe in a country like Japan, where there is a lot of money, or a rich country, the government has the budget to distribute the money to the citizens. But in the majority of cases, especially in poor countries, they don't have enough money to do that. So that means, in the worst cases, you don't have the right to get the vaccine or get the drug, which means you are dead in those kinds of times. \n\nAnd secondly, why it's problematic is that it will slow the development of the new drugs. For example, maybe company A has made an original COVID-19 vaccine, and company B are very specific and talk us through at the Delta Cup or another cup, but in that world, you don't have the patent, you don't have the rights to use the patent, or the patent is not released later, please. And so, company B have to do from the scratch, right? They have to use tons of money, they have to use tons of time to do the clinical trial of those vaccines, right? In those circumstances, it will lessen the development of the new drugs. So why this is important is that when the pandemic comes, you have to get the drugs or the vaccine to help many people. \n\n<POI> We can see that helping people is quite important, but even if it is not a situation of the worldwide pandemic, still there are a lot of patients who are struggling with diseases. Why you can focus on the situation of those kind of worldwide pandemic? Why you can have the right to still do the property that you recover investigation? \n\nMy partner will answer this question. \n\nSo moving on to the second point, how our side is better. What we think is that in the world where the patents will be released, it will fasten the development of the new drugs, because for two reasons. \n\nFirstly, when the patent is disclosed, it means that many companies have access, more competition will happen, and when there are no patents, many companies have the opportunity to get that information. That means that company A can use that information, and company B can't use it. So in that circumstances, maybe in the world there are patents. This Western first company who has a patent will not feel like making development, but because all the information is disclosed, those companies will be rushed to do another. \n\nAnd the second reason why it will fasten the development, is that each company can use the proficiency skill, or their specialty of that institute. For example, maybe company A is good at designing clinical trials or using digital tools and twins, like using AI things, or maybe company B can use it. In those circumstances, each company can use their own skill, which means that the development gets scaled from those original information. So we think, because of two reasons, we think it will be fastening the development, and the accessibility of the drug will be opened. For this reason, I'm happy to propose. Thank you."", 1: ""Thank you, Chair. Patent right has proven to be a powerful engine of innovation, driving progress and fostering unprecedented technological advancement. On this side of the government, unfortunately, disincentivized pharmaceutical corporations not to innovate this kind of important vaccination or medication during times of economic. That's why, unfortunately, from the perspective of practical consequences, the more people will not be able to medicate it, unfortunately. And in the principal consequences, unfortunately, today's government is unfortunately invading the important property rights of the patent. \n\nI have three things to tell you. Number one, I will explain the counter model as opposition. And number two, I will explain the principle argument and why the patent should work as important property right and why government shouldn't invade it. And number three, I will talk about today's government, unfortunately, disincentivizing the medical innovation. And the more people is going to die in their power. \n\nSo let's move on to the first issue about the model. So first of all, I'm going to support that, of course, the status quo situation, right? So pharmaceutical corporation still has a patent. And so the other company wants to use the technology for a patent. Of course, they need to pay to some extent of money for the corporation. \n\nSo number two, and we are very happy to compromise, to introduce license fee to obligatory that kind of the Western pharmaceutical corporation needs to accept a release to some extent of patent with a significant amount of fee. And even if this fee is unacceptable or the sky-high expensive and other corporations not actually accessible, we can, of course, adjust the amount of fee to the acceptable one. So this is the best compromise I can do. \n\nAnd more than that, we are, of course, very happy to subsidize those medical corporations to actually harsh the development of medical medicine or vaccination. We'll be happy to enhancement of the investment or lending. So this is our model. \n\nSo let's move on to the first issue in terms of principle level of the patent, why it has to work as important property, right? So we need to admit Western pharmaceutical company patent as very important as a property, right? So forcing the pharmaceutical corporation to release the patent is invasion of their property, right? So why is that? Because they actually made a lot of effort for many two reasons. \n\nOf course, they are the only one spend so much cost, right? So they, of course, invest on the lab. They develop machine or mathematical model. They, of course, invest massive amount of human resources, hiring outstanding scientists or engineering members and so on, which is a unique effort that other corporation is not doing. That's why they can reach out to the development and they can get patent. \n\nAnd number two, of course, they spend so much time to develop this kind of patent, right? And this is not a short-term effort. They actually use the technology for a long time and they develop this kind of patent with spending so much long-term perspective, such as 5 to 10 years or not only just a few months, a few days, right? So this kind of consistent effort time and the cost is an important reason. So the result that they develop can actually reach the good innovation, such as effective vaccination, such as mask to eliminate molecule of COVID, such as good medication against the pandemic, like flu, influenza, or so forth, right? \n\nSo those all medical development, it's all attributed from corporation's effort, hoping their sustainable profit as a form of patent, right? So government actually ignore this kind of effort and certainly they set the arbitral criteria of emergence and this kind of situation is not acceptable. \n\nBefore moving on any... Okay, let's move on to... So analogy of this, why this is not acceptable is, of course, the first would be, so even if there's any scarcity, even if there's any shortage of food or on this kind of situation, of course, government cannot certainly say they're going to nationalize the food factory or food industry, right? Even if the AI development is actually raising and probably this unlock their many trouble in the world, of course, we cannot force AI corporations such as just GPT or Microsoft to release their patent related to AI industry, right? So we are not saying that because we admit the importance of property, right? \n\nSo let's move on to the second issue about decentralization of innovation. So of course, as I said, to develop this kind of medical products, it costs actually a lot, right? So like I say, they need to invest a lot and they need to develop their unique mathematical model or something like this, right? And also they are not actually certain whether or not this kind of medication is actually going to be needed in the future because it's very uncertain whether or not the development of the current medicine is going to be effective in the future or whether or not actually another pandemic will come in the future. They can also assess that.\n\nBut as long as there's the patent to create a sustainable money for company, that's why they have actually massive motivation to keep innovating and investing these kinds of products. So for example, in the case of pandemic, of course, vaccine and medicines demand increase. That's a lot of corporation wants to develop effective products. And if one company developing the outstanding product, of course, other corporation is also wants to use the patent to get the technology and they can also have massive incentive to sophisticate the product with the patent, right? That's why this kind of patent is actually important key essence to unlock difficulty of innovating medication. \n\nWhat's going to happen in after plan? First of all, of course, there's very few profit for pharmaceutical corporation. It's not a profitable situation at all, right? So that's why the research and development fee is going to be cut for this kind of corporation. That's why the important, for example, the medication against the COVID or flu is also going to be cut when they're going to probably move to other industry, such as just the investing on generic medication, which can be effective but not critical for the COVID situation. This kind to save more people, to preserve principle importance of patent."", 2: ""First, I want to start with the characterization of the large corporations. In order to prove without this policy, malicious utilization of the patent will happen, and they dominate profit by excluding small corporations or venture corporations who have the potential to produce that important medicine or technology as much as possible on their side of the house, which means their counterproposal is too soft to prevent this policy. \n\nWe see in the status quo, those large corporations strongly exclude venture corporations or startup corporations on their side of the house. We see large corporations try to purchase the patent, which venture corporations or small corporations also have in the status quo. Therefore, those new important technologies or knowledge will be dominated by large corporations on their side of the house. Also, we see, evergreen, once their patent will be expired, large corporations try to introduce similar patents in order to perpetuate this unfair social structure for the small or venture corporations. Therefore, other consequences, those technologies, medicine, will be totally dominated, and malicious utilization of the patent will happen on their side of the house. \n\nWhy do you see this actually happen? It's very simple. Because corporations, large corporations, are inherently short-sighted because they have to cater to the interests of the shareholders. We see in the case of the breach of trust, we look at the case of the British. Shareholders can cause lawsuits against a company as long as corporations don't take action to maximize their benefit if they don't cater to the profit of the shareholders. That's why those malicious utilizations strongly happen without a disposal under the model. \n\nOpposition may say, hey, those corporations have a natural incentive to care about reputation, et cetera. That's why those malicious utilizations are unlikely to happen, et cetera. But I don't think this is likely because, as I already talked to you, corporations are inherently short-sighted and profit-seeking. Therefore, the malicious utilization are likely to happen on their side of the house. \n\nAnd also, what we got from side of the opposition is that under our model, this incentivization to research and development could happen, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think this is likely in the first place. Because when it comes to the pandemic, when it comes to the pharmacy, obviously, large demands strongly exist. In the case of COVID-19, many people try to vaccinate or utilize medicine again and again. For example, in Japan, at least three times, those people have to utilize. Therefore, even if large corporations lose the patent, anyway, those corporations have a natural incentive to enter the industry of the pharmacy, and so they have a natural incentive to commit the research and the development to begin with. \n\nAnd secondly, especially when it comes to the pharmacy, their products directly connecting to the reputation, increasing reputation, because their products directly connecting, like saving life, saving precious life. Therefore, if their knowledge of technology will be compromised because of this policy, still those corporations have a natural incentive to enter their industry to begin with. \n\nAnd also, we tell you, disincentivization rather happens on their side of the house. Because, as I already talked to you, many of the technology or medicine will be taught to be dominated by the large corporations, right? Once a venture corporation or small corporation, even if a small corporation or venture corporation tries to opt into that industry, their knowledge, their technology, are totally dominated by the large corporations. Therefore, those corporations who have less financial capacity lose incentive to enter this industry more and more on their side of the house. But before that, yes. \n\n<POI> I understand to some extent, there is a huge demand for medication during the pandemic. But by releasing patent and thousands of companies actually started selling the same products, which is not actually profitable, how still your side of the pharmaceutical corporation has a massive incentive for innovation? \n\nObviously, even if the patent will be disclosed to the public, for example, as my partner already talked to you, each corporation has their own strong point, right? For example, like a specific knowledge, like a corporation A has a specific knowledge of A, corporation B has a specific knowledge of B, or et cetera, et cetera. Therefore, yes, we can see an important basis of the medicine or important basis of the technology are shared by every single corporation. However, another corporation can put additional benefit or additional functionality of the technology or medicine or those kind of things. Therefore, by doing so, each corporation easily differentiates each other. Therefore, those corporations still can gain the benefit on our side of the house. And also we think what we got from their side of the house, like the invasion of the right of the corporation. \n\nBut I think, as I already talked to you, when it comes to the pandemic, especially many dying right now, the right of the corporation should be compromised in order to maximize the potential of the corporation to begin with. Because as I already talked to you, those corporations are strongly blocked by the larger corporation in the status quo. Therefore, in terms of corporate social responsibility, I think their rights should be compromised to begin with. Therefore, we think we have to propose. Thank you very much for that fine speech. Thank you. \n"", 3: ""Existence of the patent is a rarely activated competition, we believe, which can drive businesses to continually improve their products and services. This is actually giving benefits to the consumer and society as a whole. That is what we are happy to hear about this motion. \n\nBefore moving on to my substantive, let me quickly go back to what the previous speaker said. First of all, he said venture companies do not take action to invest or develop new technology. We don't think so, even in current situations. A lot of venture companies can take enough action. For example, let me take the example of the case of COVID-19. Moderna is actually a venture company. This was built after 2010. Of course, we already know that they do not have enough monetary capacity, but if they can invest in beautiful technology, they can invest it by a lot of investors from the whole of society, and they can earn money from the society. We think even in this house, enough technology is actually made by those kinds of companies. \n\nSecond of all, he said that the companies just take the short-term benefits. We don't think so also. Because such companies also invest from a lot of people, at the moment, if they just focus on the short-term benefits from the society, on the other hand, they also have to consider long-term benefits. For example, utilizing their patents or continuously selling new products to the society. That's why we think such malicious usage of patents is less likely to happen. Because if they maliciously make so many expensive fees to just use such patents technology, of course, no one would want to use it. That's why we don't think that kind of situation is actually happening. \n\nOkay, next, moving on to my substantive. First of all, while releasing the patent is a completely undermined motivation to develop new technology, and unfortunately, the existence of information itself is obviously declining in that part of this house. Secondly, as a property right, why we should not arbitrarily steal such kind of property from the entire company, even in the case of pandemic cases. So, lastly, let me compare each part. \n\nFirst of all, while releasing the patent is completely undermined motivation to develop new technology. So, in that part, the company has two choices. If you develop new technology, first of all, you can share such kind of information as a patent to the whole society. Actually, we can know how to make it, what kind of substance is actually in such kind of drug or something like that. But if you try to use such kind of technology or information itself, at the moment, they have to pay money or something like that. This is the case of the one. \n\nThe second of all, they still have the choice to hinder such kind of information itself to the society because they do not want to share information to the society, even if it deals as a patent. Still, in that society, the company tries to hinder such kind of mechanism or something like that. For example, as my partner already mentioned, such kind of algorithm is actually hindered even in the current situation. In their part of the task, there is no patent at all. As a situation, why such kind of company has a motivation to share information, how to make it those kind of drug itself. In that society, there is no mechanism from the entire government side. That is why, in the first place, they cannot recover such kind of investigation, as my partner already mentioned, or more than that. So, rather, we believe they try to hinder those kind of new technology, the methods to make new products. They try to hinder and just maliciously utilize those kind of methods to earn money. So, that's why we think this is completely problematic. \n\nOkay, let's move on to the second substantive. So, why we think that stealing the property shouldn't be tolerated even in any circumstances. As my point of information mentioned, even if it is the situation of the worldwide pandemic, even not the situation of the worldwide pandemic, still, we can find a lot of people, a lot of patients, who are actually struggling with any kind of diseases. In that case of urgency, of course, we have to tackle, we have to solve those kind of patients, even if it is not the case of the worldwide pandemic. \n\nBut, unfortunately, they arbitrarily decide a line to distinguish which person should be helped in the case of the worldwide pandemic. We don't think those kinds of situations can be traced. Why is that? Because in our paradigm of this house, existing patterns actually activate new technology or methods in the first place. That is why we think this should be treated as a special thing. \n\nSo, let me compare the two perspectives. First of all, the motivation. Even in the short term or long term, we think our side is outweighed. Because, as my partner already mentioned, even if this is an existing pattern, still, a lot of companies can utilize those kind of methods. More than that, companies have the motivation to recover a lot of investigations. \n\nBut in their paradigm of this house, they try to hinder such kind of information, or more than that, they try to replace other kinds of investigations, not related to such kind of pandemic or crucial diseases in the worldwide. So, lastly, we shouldn't decide arbitrarily what kind of diseases should be solved. So, that's what we have to do."", 4: ""Okay. Thank You chair. We think we find the big contraction from this contradiction from the side of the house because they never explained how to adjust in their counter model. They will adjust the patent or something like that, but how they decide the price or something like that? It's completely unbiased and unclear and that's why we think it's out of this space. It's very big due to theirs. \n\nTheir explanation and the meeting if we think of the so we say we think the motivation itself are that this device the same thing? We think we as my father will tell you there are a lot of alternative incentive for that kind of Cooperation and even if the disincentivization to some extent happen winning is still the benefit I said even if we think feel that the incentive of cooperation will remain and that's why we think the development of Our paradigm explanation is much better. \n\nYeah, I'm gonna talk about two issues. Let me talk about motivation. Secondly, let me talk about the principle model. \n\nBefore that, let me talk about rebuttal. So they, the DL, will try to say and why? So they ask them why only during the pandemic or something like that. But let me talk about what is the difference between the normal situation and the pandemic is very clear, right? Because that is a very short time and it suddenly happens, right? We think so in normal situation where we can use, for example, the genetic medicine, for example, can be available and it is a better fight. So in several cases and that's why we have a lot of all parties. But in emergency cases in pandemic cases, we don't have any time to wait to generate, for example. We think because that is especially in the emergency cases, we think we should open a release.\n\nYeah, let me talk about motivation. They said I think we can share the pattern. So as I put it out their counterfactual is very big in this process, right? Because they said they have the choice corporation still have the choice to hinder or that kind of thing. \n\nBut at the same time, they say that they will force the adjuster according to their model. But we think how if we think of the how they adjust the prices of opening the patent, for example. Yeah, probably they're gonna be the pressurization by the society. For example, Yeah, you should do that because you are the big corporation you owe it. There is kind of CSR or that kind of thing, right? And also probably they will, also if we think of the incentive of the government who will restrict or who will adjust the prices of patent, etc, etc. Probably they will cater to the population, right? If the population or the situation in the society, we think about we need the vaccination because that is very important It should be open or that kind of thing, probably they will cater to the population. That means that even in their patent, probably Yeah, so their argument is completely not mutually exclusive to some extent.\n\nAnd moreover, we think So And notice that they said, how to say, yeah, yes We have to share but the sharing the information itself means that not only means that you have to share your own information But at the same time you can use other corporation information, right? That brings us the very good argument that my partner tell you, right? Then that real position tries to say that this incentive will happen But they're gonna be still the benefit, right? For example, the reputation is gonna be improved if they can make the first vaccination to the COVID, right? They talk about the case of the Moderna, for example, right? \n\nSo if that is true, even if they do not have the patent to some extent, making the vaccination itself The fact itself is enough fact to prove the power of Moderna, for example, the certain corporations. And that means that Investors anyway have the incentive to do that because they have the power to make such kind of wonderful Vaccination, for example, right? In that kind of moment, we think still they're gonna be the benefit for the corporation.\n\n<POI> With or without pandemic, every single medical product to some extent save life and somehow critical for some people. Do you also think a multiple corporation should release other type of medical patents such as medical medicine for diabetes or cancer? \n\nIt depends, right? Because they Firstly, that is not a mutual exclusive because how they try to deal with that kind of problem is a very unclear process But moreover, we think that they also said adjust, right? It is the same thing So we will we have to think about the benefit of the corporation. But also the situation in society We have to balance that kind of thing If we think of that kind of thing, we think in this pandemic case, we should release that kind of patent.\n\nThen they also try to talk about so that they're not gonna develop and it is very unclear that whether they're gonna be the necessity to that kind of medicine. That's why they're gonna refrain from making it. But because for example, as my partner also told you, because they have the connection with government, right? They are very known about the lobbying, for example in America In that kind of movement, that is the reason why the Japanese government is requiring three times the vaccination in Japan. In that kind of movement, we think they can maintain the necessity of their development. For that kind of thing that means that they still have the incentive to do that. \n\nAnd also notice that they are going to be the pressurization by the society, right? Because you dominate a lot of the information, you dominate a lot of the patents, etc, etc. Then they're gonna pressurize you. Why don't you do that?\n\nThe conclusion here is even if this incentivization is to some extent true. Still they are going to be the benefit for starting kind of their corporation. And once they make new medicine and release the patent, as my partner told you, there are no restrictions from their side of the house, that's development advance, right? For example, because of the competition within the corporation, right? For example, they try to make the vaccination with lighters, high-definition, that kind of things can easily happen.\n\nThen let me talk about the principle. Firstly, their principle is very general to some extent, right? Because they just talk about how the patent is important. But they never ever explain why that is unique to the pandemic case in the first place, right? \n\nBut moreover, secondly, they're based on the exploit. So moreover, we can mitigate the damage of that kind of things that they try to talk about, because not all patents are going to be released in our paradigm As my partner clearly told you in the model, just that it's related to the COVID or the pandemic cases, right? In that kind of moment, their case, principle case, is also not unique in the first place and not important in this way. So for these reasons, we think that we can, yeah We can, in the pandemic cases, we can save more people in our paradigm. That's why we propose."", 5: ""Three things in summation. Firstly, the principal issue, utilitarianism versus the property right, and secondly, the incentive of cooperation in status quo, and thirdly, the incentive of cooperation after plan adoption. \n\nSo let's start. Firstly, in terms of the principle issues, you may agree that the general importance of property rights, which we already explained to you, because the patent right is simply the fruit of investment of research and development of pharmaceutical corporations, and therefore this is guaranteed as a property right. This is nothing different from buying the land or constructing the factory by investing the money. \n\nWe think that there is no difference between physical property rights and intellectual property rights. And actually, in many countries, the patent law explains discreetly that the patent right is one of the property rights. That's why we think this is, in general, this is particularly important. And what we already proven to you in this debate is that this is not acceptable, even in the context of the emergency cases, that this is the deprival of property rights is unacceptable. \n\nTheir only claim is that in emergent cases, this is acceptable. If this is true, for example, if the factory exists, which can produce the vaccine, we can buy this kind of factory regardless of their consent of cooperation and forcibly produce the vaccine. Or if the land exists, in this case, which is suitable for producing the vaccine, that we can forcibly construct the factory and produce the medicine, or that we can forcibly work the doctors or scientists in order to tackle down COVID-19, for example. We think that as long as they fail to explain to what extent the property rights or the rights of the individual, or the rights of the corporation, can be infringed under the name of the arbitrary criteria of emergency, we think their case must fail. Therefore, the general principle of property rights is particularly important. \n\nAnd more than that, the arbitrariness of this kind of emergency in terms of focusing on the medical patent is particularly unjust. They mention that in the emergent cases, there is no alternative not to this kind of utilizing patent. Firstly, if you look at even just in Japan, Moderna, Pfizer, KMBIO, Novavax, and so on and so forth, there are lots of alternatives to this. In the worldwide cases, for example, the Chinese vaccine corporation is using alternatives doing this. That's why there is no strong necessity, as they mention that. \n\nAnd secondly, in the ordinary cases, if one corporation, for example, invests a wonderful anti-cancer drug, in this case, for the cancer patient, there is no alternative for 20 years, but nothing from this kind of wonderful corporation. Therefore, we think the emergency is not so a constitutional component of this kind of established, trikle down the importance of property rights. Therefore, we see utilitarianism cannot trickle down the property rights. That's why we are very proud to oppose this motion. \n\nSo let's move on. Based on this kind of principle, let's move on to the practical issues in terms of incentive of the corporation in the status quo. There is still a reason why the country, the corporation, have no incentive to spread the vaccine. Firstly, the very simple question is very factual. Actually, in the worldwide, vaccine is spread as a result of the kindness of the corporation. This is very simple proof that their case must fail. \n\nAnd on the more logical and debatable level, they mention that this is short-sighted. We think that vaccination is not only the spread in terms of vaccination, it's not only the short-term profit, but also that their KPI includes a reputation risk in terms of their own property, because the ESG is a particularly important criteria in the current investment criteria. Therefore, they are more careful about the reputation risk in the first place. That's why not only the just profit by selling the vaccine, but also the prevalence rate in the population is also the important KPI for the management of the pharmaceutical corporation. Therefore, the analysis of short-sightedness is failed. \n\nAnd they also mention that knowledge share will be failed. But if you take a look at the very basic of the patent, because I actually offer the similar patent and I have similar patent after entering chemical corporations. Firstly, after sending the patent to the office, and 1.5 years after, the patent information is opened to all over the world. And after the request of the examination, the patent office examines the newness and technological advancement of the patent, and the patent will be registered. This is the very basic knowledge of the patent. We think that's why after, if the corporation decides to open the patent to get the patent right, their knowledge will be shared. That's why there are some specific features of the corporation that can be shared as worldwide knowledge in our paradigm. We think this is nothing proven in the first place. \n\nThey also mentioned Evergreen. Again, we think that Evergreen is difficult, particularly in a more competitive field, because there is necessity in terms of technological advancement, not only newness. That's why just a similar patent cannot be guaranteed as right, because they reject it as there is no technological advancement, the gap is not technologically advanced. Therefore, their case must fail. \n\nIn terms of the incentive of the corporation, we think this is fine. And in terms of if the corporation has the motivation to build a factory, or ODM the factory, and they sell the vaccine, this is fine. And if licensing is necessary, this is also fine. For those, for two ways of their own production and their licensing, we can guarantee, actually in the status quo, we can guarantee the number of vaccines, the number of drugs, we think this is no problem at all. \n\nSo thirdly, finally, the incentive of the corporation after production. We think the incentive of the corporation ended from two perspectives. Firstly, as the leader of the corporation mentioned, they stopped investing in the research and development, because simply the pharmaceutical corporation's R&D ratio is very, very high. That's why tremendous profit is necessary. But if they possibly sell the patent, at some point of time of the pandemic, this profit is particularly limited. But if they continue, for example, in the half a year, vaccination is recommended in Japan, in this case their benefit will be skyrocketing compared to the selling at a certain time of the pandemic. That's why this kind of incentive comparison is particularly significant for the corporation. \n\nAnd if they still continue investing in the R&D situation, if this kind of precedence of possibly selling or possibly buying of the patent exists, in this particular occasion they stop opening that information, they stop registering the patent. Instead of that, they hinder the process as a know-how of their own corporation. This kind of knowledge sharing, as they mentioned, is never ever achieved. Therefore, even if the Italian benefit outside of this area, we are very proud to oppose. Thank you very much for that fine speech. Now on to the reply portion of this debate."", 6: ""I'm going to talk about two issues with my speaker. Number one, I will deeply examine the practical consequences, which can actually save more people by encouragement of the medical innovation. Second of all, I will look at the principal argument. Is that actually patent as property, right? It can be compromised in this specific occasion, as governments say, or still we need to preserve it. \n\nSo let's move on to the first issue about the practical consequences. So actually, let's move on the important question. That's actually government side of pharmaceutical corporation still have motivation for keep investing the research and development of the medical sphere. So we are saying as an opposition, so patent is critically important to create sustainable money, which can be paid off by their important research development fee. So on this point, government say three things. \n\nNumber one, so opposition stance also kills medical motivations, right? Because we are also, sometimes it's necessary, we also obligatory introduce license system to avoid a dominance and a fee, which is actually adjusted by government side. So what we are saying from position is this stance is the best compromisation to be able to coexist the medical corporation's motivations and also property rights over the patent, right? \n\nAnd also, government is actually not decide the unacceptably extremely cheaper price. So government is, of course, to calculate how much is actually acceptable by looking into the cost that pharmaceutical corporation invest on. And of course, they would like to consider the benefit from this patent. That's why the price isn't extremely low and is going to be adjusted. This is the nuance of adjusted price. That's why the still pharmaceutical corporation have massive incentive to keep investing. \n\nAnd also they say, even in the consequences without a patent, still this kind of vaccination is needed and demand is high. That's why those corporations still have motivation to keep innovating, right? So, but the price is completely different from just a selling one shot of vaccination or medication, which can be priced as 1,000 yen or something like that, versus the patent, which can be sold 1,000,000 yen to a specific corporation. \n\nAnd we think this 1,000,000 yen is a very important price for this kind of pharmaceutical corporation. So to be able to pay off their cost, which is actually very expensive, human risk in hiring important scientists or engineering team or investing in their machine or mathematical model, right? And of course, this kind of 1,000,000 yen or 2,000% of the very seemingly expensive for public people is still accessible if other pharmaceutical corporation has massive incentive to take advantage of the patent, right? \n\nAnd other point, they say, that many corporation is going to, other thing we like to say, other corporation is, of course, going to take a free ride, this kind of patent. And this kind of market is going to be certainly red ocean, right? That's why, usually, the free riding is, of course, cheaper in terms of cost of performance. And no other pharmaceutical corporation has the first winner. So that's why, in terms of motivation, unfortunately, their side cannot win. \n\nSo moving on to the principal case. So first of all, unfortunately, they never, ever cut the principal importance of fundamental patent as property right in the first place. And they're just saying this is kind of emergency situation. But things like emergency does not justify every single act to limit the human right and also corporation right, as Takai-san say. That's why, in the case of general principal level, we also win. That's why we shouldn't allow government abusive status. "", 7: ""Thank you, Chairperson. They lose this weight for two reasons. \n\nFirst, contradictory stance from their side of the house. What we got from their side of the house, like invasion of the property, etc, etc, but on the other hand, they say they are happy to make property be low, to guarantee the accessibility, etc, etc. I don't think to what extent property rights should be respected, because of their contradictory stance. \n\nSecond, they didn't explain under their counterfactual how domination and delay of the research and development can be possible on their side of the house. What we got from their side of the house, well, some venture corporation like Moderna actually succeeded, etc, etc. But what they try to do is just pick up a useful case, a comfortable case for government opposition. To begin with, they didn't explain in any logic how the relatively vulnerable corporation, like the venture corporation, can override the domination by the large corporation, which government side constantly indicated from the very beginning. \n\nBut let's look at their case. What we got from their side of the house is that invasion of the property, right? Like opposition side tried to say, well, government side didn't explain to what extent corporation rights should be compromised, even in emergency cases, etc, etc. But that case, that indication can be set for government side as well, because opposition side, in general, tried to say property rights should be protected, etc, etc. \n\nBut they also didn't explain to what extent patent in emergency case, in this motion, particularly important as well. That's why this claim is not mutually exclusive. Yes, we can see government side didn't do well, but on the other hand, opposition side also didn't do well. Therefore, that cannot be the metric to choose which side we win. And also, their argument are completely example-based to begin with, analogy-based to begin with, because maybe opposition will give us logic, but it's too late. \n\nAnd also, I think, but we think the main line from government side is that, well, whether or not this motion, this incentive corporation to commit to research and development, etc, etc. But as we already talked to you, there are, as we already talked to you, this incentivization is likely to happen for several reasons. One, this industry have a huge demand to begin with. \n\nSecond of all, committing this industry will contribute to improving the corporation reputation, because it's directly connecting saving precious life. \n\nAnd third, yes, we can see that corporation have to give their own information to public, but on the other hand, that corporation also utilize the information of the other corporation as well. \n\nThat's why disincentivization are less likely to happen, but we didn't hear a stronger refutation from their side. Therefore, we think this motion should be judged in terms of a practical manner, whether or not the profit of the corporation are suddenly devastated by taking this motion to begin with. But government side strongly tell you disincentivization are less likely to happen, and because of this motion, competition and research and development will be faster. As a consequence, we can save the people as much as possible. Therefore, we next vote.""}"
6,【The関西GFモーションを高校生にやってもらった】mixidea高校生定期練習,TH opposes the “Defining Decade norm”.,"{0: ""What's unique in being a young adult is that you have the opportunity to enjoy your time, and we don't think that it's good for these young adults to look into the far future where they're trying to imagine and throw away and sacrifice all their immediate needs for a future that is not guaranteed. I'm happy to oppose. \n\nWhat is our stance? We're not gonna defend a world like what opposition is likely to do and characterize as a world where people are gonna be lazy, they're just gonna procrastinate all the time. We're not gonna defend those kind of extreme cases. We think that our burden in this debate is going to be proving about like people that we're gonna prove. Our burden is to prove that people shouldn't feel guilty about watching Netflix, for instance, as a break. They shouldn't be shunned for debating as extracurricular activities and doing something that might not get them into that. We think that's the case we're gonna be supporting today. We don't think what opposition is likely to come up here and talk about all these lazy people are gonna emerge is gonna be at the expense of this debate. It's just gonna prove to you why there's gonna be important needs to not neglecting immediate desires. \n\nWith that in mind, three things in my speech. First, I'll be explaining why this will affect the health of these young adults, especially when they're in college or around the age of 18 to 25. Secondly, I'll be explaining why this specifically harms these kinds of stakeholders of young people apart from health. And thirdly, I'll be explaining societal harms.\n\nFirst, let's talk about health. We think what's gonna happen and the contextualization I'm gonna provide and what this defining decade norm is literally people who have to stay up until 4 a.m. studying for exams, people who neglect and throw away their mental and physical health for the sake of trying to gain and maximize these educational values. I think this is extremely bad for a couple of reasons. It's because we think that this success isn't guaranteed. Because no matter how long you stay awake until 4 a.m. and study, we think it rather degrades the kind of quality of education you gain. We think that's gonna lead to people overworking at the expense of their physical habits. And when this happens, we think there's likely to be two scenarios.\n\nThat is, one is that in the case of failure or success eitherwise, is that you're gonna push yourself harder. That's literally the reason why so many Asian Asians face overwork or suicide as an example. We think that in these cases, these mental health are gonna be significantly harmed. I think this is gonna be much worse in the case of the long term, which opposition is likely gonna defend. So at this point, we think there's gonna be long-term harms considering this point. \n\nBut secondly, is that you're gonna be more likely to give up once any kind of failure hits you. We think that you're not gonna have any options to pursue because you literally neglected and sacrificed every single other kind of option you had. We think this is extremely problematic compared to our side, where we at least have some other options to fall back on. We think we prioritize these immediate needs such as physical, mental health, or any kind of social bonding. In these cases, opposition is gonna be a world where failure cannot be justified. Where failure is not gonna be justified. And in the case of failure happens, we think there's no gonna be kind of falling back on their cases.\n\nLet me move on to my second point, talking about the most important part of what's gonna happen to young people. We think that the characterization of young people is that they're gonna still rely, they can still rely on their parents, they have the freedom to do something. But in the case of when there's a culture norm that urges people to persistently just pursue life goals, we think that people are gonna lose their capability of finding their identities. That is, the people won't think of taking gap years at universities, for instance. They're not gonna have the option of switching between jobs, for instance. They're just gonna be looking after just one job and trying to stick to that because of this kind of norm which tries to stigmatize idle time and just seek these kinds of instrumental values. \n\nWe think you neglect any kind of the young youthful experience, that is the station you could undergo in this experience, that is like partying, having fun, and I don't know, just enjoying the cultural part of life, right? Not just to try to maximize educational life in your experience. \n\nWhen this happens, we think when you go into this kind of defining decade norm is that you're gonna reject any kind of friends because you're just gonna try to gain and reap the benefits you have of social relationships. This is gonna mean that you won't have any kind of a personal connection between people. \n\nFour impacts of this. First is that there's gonna be, again, long-term no social connection, that in the future you're most likely not have any kind of personal friends because you literally chose your social relationships based on only benefits. That's gonna mean that you're not gonna have any kind of friends or any lovers that you love between each other. We think that in the long term, you're not gonna have social connections. In the long term, we say it's gonna be worse. \n\nBut secondly is that morally you can't enjoy the aspects of youth, right? That when you consider this, when the important part of youth is enjoying your life and trying to find what you want to do in the future, we think it's bad when you go into this norm and you try to just specifically choose one life coach and try to go under this, right? We think morally you won't be able to enjoy this. \n\n<POI> In your model, you said that you won't defend people who are lazy and procrastinators, but why do you say that this is an extreme case? \n\nNo, so what I meant by extreme cases was you probably talking about extreme cases like NEET. I'm saying that even if people are lazy to some extent, that should be acknowledged and that should be respected as a form of life as long as it doesn't create like massive haybock among others.\n\nThird impact is that in the long term, you're gonna feel left out, right? You're gonna have other people like enjoying life as they were while you are here like not knowing what to do. After you achieve the life goal in the first place, we think you're gonna be left out. That in the long term, you're gonna actually regret the decisions you had by going under going this kind of norm. \n\nBut fourthly is that when you go under jobs and even in the case that it turns out to be like very crappy, you're unlikely to quit because you perceive that kind of job as your only life goal. You're likely to live a more miserable life under their side. \n\nWith that in mind, my third argument about societal harms is that we think that these people are then gonna think of themselves as just individual benefits. They're just not gonna think about society benefits. That is that in cases of elections, you're likely to not fund unemployment benefits. You're likely to kind of neglect affirmative action for minorities, for instance, and perhaps neglect climate change issues. \n\nWe think what's gonna happen is you're gonna rather prioritize what's gonna happen in the long-term like future and not vote for things that are important to you at that time, right? We think that as a narrative, you're gonna believe that your work will be able to overcome any barrier and likely to neglect the immediate needs that people have.\n\nThree impacts. One is that this could lead to lower birth rates because people won't have any kind of loving relationships. \n\nBut secondly is the jobs are likely to be worse because people are gonna be suffering. They're gonna have to overwork at the expense of trying to do anything. They won't be have time to relax and just enjoy life as it is. \n\nAnd thirdly is that just policies will be just worse off because you're gonna not focus on the immediate urgent policies that need to be implemented in the status quo. For all these reasons, defining decade norms should never be protected."", 1: ""To achieve the long-term benefit for young adults, we believe that young adults do not have enough experience to choose the best decision for themselves. And there will be the habit to give up easily. At this point, we believe that these kinds of norms will make the atmosphere that young adults will be happy in the future and they can make effort and they can endure the difficulty they face. So that's why we believe that there should be these kinds of norms so that young adults can live happily in the future.\n\nFirst of all, let me rebut their arguments. First of all, about their health. They said that young adults will consume too much of their time to maximize the benefit. How is it? First of all, this is not true. This is because when they harm their physical health or something like that, it can be easily imagined that it will harm their future. For example, they said that people will study until 4 am or something like that. These kinds of things cannot be efficient. For example, if you get enough sleep, the effectiveness will be much bigger.\n\nSo we believe that health can lead to efficiency and people will do much healthier behavior when they think of the future. For example, a lot of people drink alcohol and a lot of people do tobacco. These kinds of things happen just to meet the immediate demand. However, we believe that these kinds of things are harming their health. However, we believe that when they think of the future, they cannot do these kinds of unhealthy things. So we believe that people will have much more health benefit when they think of the future. \n\nThe second rebut against is about friends. They said that young adults will tend to only reject friends because it will not be beneficial. However, this is not true. We believe that friends are an important thing for the future. For example, when you get a job, it will be much more beneficial for you if you have a lot of friends. For example, if you have friends who are good at mathematics, you can rely on these kinds of friends. When you have friends, it means that there are a lot of people who you can rely on. And we believe that when thinking of the future, young adults will have friends and will not be like the situation that young adults get all the friends. That's literally my point. \n\n<POI>If you seek this kind of like trying to have a friend who's good at mathematics, you're likely to throw away the relationship once you don't need them anymore. Why is that good? \n\nSo I think she said that people will just young adults will just choose friends who seem to be beneficial themselves. However, we believe that these kinds of things will not be completely the bad thing because they can have a friend. And these kinds of things will be beneficial to their future. And this is not a bad thing.\n\nThen let me tell our first argument. Our first argument is that young adults will lose the long-term benefit. So let me talk about two things. First thing is about young adults do not have enough experience. So because of the not enough experience, they tend to make wrong decisions when they see back what they have done. For example, they will only think about what they want to do now. And they will behave to meet their immediate demand. For example, like eating or like playing with their friends or like drinking tapioca. These kinds of things will be much more done when they are young without these kinds of defining norms.\n\nAnd the second thing is that there will be the habit to give up easily. So for example, without these kinds of norms, young adults will be much more or will tend to do what they want to do. And even if they have one thing that they want to do in the future, they will give up. Because to realize these kinds of dreams, it is common that young adults have to face a lot of difficulties. Young adults will only give up when they face these difficulties because they will not think of the future. They will just seek the immediate demand and they will give up when they face difficulties. So why these kinds of things are serious? So when you think about the situation that without defining the norm, in the short term, young adults may feel happiness. However, in the long term, there will be a habit to give up.\n\nAnd these kinds of things will lead to low quality life. For example, when young adults do not study enough, they cannot get into a good university. And they will have difficulty in getting a job because the academic skills are now in society a lot prioritized. So they will have difficulty in getting a lot of money and money will lead to less choice. So a lot of choice will diminish because of the less of the money and less of the effort of themselves. For example, like buying a house, marrying, having a child. However, with these kinds of defining decay norms, there will be atmosphere that you will be happy in the future if you make effort now. Because of this atmosphere, young people can endure the effort and endure facing difficulties. In the long term, they will feel happiness because they can do what they want to do. They can do what they want to do, what they have been since they were young. Thank you."", 2: ""First of all, I will revert their argument. They argue that it's okay to discard relationships because focusing on the future will lead to long-term happiness. However, this neglects the uniqueness of the defining decade norm, which emphasizes sacrificing immediate norms for the future. This is serious because individuals, driven to be future-oriented, may become too busy with studies or work, leading to strained relationships and friendships that cannot continue.\n\nAdditionally, I support the argument that only the younger generation has the right to make choices. Young people, being at a stage where they can choose between studying and working, have the freedom to decide. However, as time passes, decisions about the future become more rigid, and the spirit to take on new challenges diminishes. If the current situation is wasted, especially for the younger generation, it becomes a serious matter as unexpected events like COVID-19 can cut lives short. Sacrificing efforts for the future might lead to sudden and irreversible consequences, a point of deep sadness for the younger population.\n\nIn the long term, the argument about the defining decade norm being beneficial loses its appeal. While it might be advantageous for some to enter good universities and secure financial stability, it may not be great for everyone. The sudden loss of lives and diminishing choices over the years due to rigid life decisions make it challenging for people to find motivation to live in the future. This hardship, especially for the younger generation, makes the defining decade norm detrimental. Therefore, I propose to oppose the defining decade norm. Thank you."", 3: ""Okay, a couple of refutations to our opponents before I get into my substantives.\n\nFirstly, we talked about this issue about health, right? If you push yourself too much, you're going to stay up until 4 am, etc., and you'll be in a bad state both mentally and physically. But firstly, as my previous speaker told you, if you really prioritize achieving your life goals or if you really prioritize educational value or more vocational skills, the most rational decision for you to make is to get like a sufficient amount of sleep. So we firstly say that there is a very low possibility that people will go to the like such an extreme case that they sacrifice their whole health, their whole mental state in order to keep studying or keep working.\n\nBut secondly, even if we take their best case and say that a certain amount of people do overwork themselves, we still see that the health risks are like equally high on their side as well. And inside the government's world, where people are encouraged and not stigmatized from prioritized instant pleasure, what we ultimately see is like you like spending time on your phone or your YouTube until midnight, or you like staying up all night at a party, or you like going out every day, or spending a lot of your money on junk food, or alcohol or tobacco, or anything that gives you that instant pleasure, right? I think comparatively, if you are going to spend a lot of your like time, like spending, spending my time and money on these kinds of unhealthy stuff, I think like the health risks are comparatively like, there's not much difference in the end, even if we take their best case.\n\nBut more importantly, let's talk about their issue about friends, right? So first of all, like they concede in the beginning that they would have some kind of friends, like only it's kind of like friends, because they're good at math or like, that kind of stuff. But firstly, we don't see the unique harm of that because you do have a friend in the end. \n\nBut secondly, we also think that like, just because you prioritize, like your life goals doesn't mean that you wouldn't have like any friends or like any lover whatsoever. I think like a relationship is not about like the quantity of friends, but like the quality. So if you do have like one really close friend or one family member, I think you could still be happy. But then again, we don't see the specific harm of this like whole relationship issue.\n\nBut then thirdly, they also talked about this like policymaking, right? How like, we won't be able to fund climate change or whatsoever. But I think that like, as a premise, you prioritizing instant pleasure is what like makes climate change is what makes climate change like an even more serious problem, right? I think the issue like this whole like you prioritizing instant pleasure is firstly like irrelevant from policymaking. I think politicians should be able to look into the future; it should have like a wider vision, right? \n\nBut like, we think that like people prioritizing instant like economic benefits, for example, is a specific reason why there won't be any like green policies for climate change, or like people like not going to quarantine, for example, or like the reason why people vote for like a populist politician is because they're short-sighted, right? They don't see like the long term harm of that, like certain politician getting into place. So in the end, when you think about policymaking, I think that it's far better for you to be pursuing life goals or for you to be like stigmatizing idle time, because I think that's what leads to proper rational decisions as a democratic citizen.\n\nBut thirdly, the opposition speaker, the second speaker talks about this issue about motivation, right? How like, if you work too much, there wouldn't be any like motivation left for you to have your dream whatsoever. But like, firstly, we negate the premise that like working hard leads to like a lack of motivation. I think that if you keep prioritizing immediate pleasure, if you keep going out to parties, if you keep slacking off, I think this is what makes you lose motivation for everything. As my first speaker talked to you, like you're the habit of like, procrastinating and the habit of prioritizing instant pleasure is what makes you like look away from these long term goals that you could be pursuing at the same time. So we think that like comparatively within the world with this kind of norm, when you push yourself to work hard, that's when you find new goals that you can work hard for, like life goals or dream jobs that you want to achieve in the future. So in terms of motivation, we also say the side opposition has a higher chance for people to be motivated and for people to be encouraged to keep working.\n\n<POI>like, as a stance, you guys are saying that when the motion literally says you're going to seek instrumental value from social relationships, or you're going to seek more responsibilities at work, and you literally neglect that kind of premise. What does your side like uniquely achieve? Because we don't understand what your side like really envisions.\n\nWell, the motion says, the motion also says that young adults who persistently pursue life goals. So I think this is also a stance that we can protect. \n\nOf course, we'll be talking about like you maximizing educational value and stuff like that. But this one ties into my substantive, which is the comparative, why our side is better. So what we exactly see inside opposition is like, as I said, like you maximizing educational value. And this means like you gain lots of skills, or you make like important relationships within like a lot of industries that help you in the future, right? Like if I get like a couple of examples, maybe you take like online courses for vocational skills, like after you come back from work, or you make like acquaintances in like different industries, or like different companies, or you like climb up the social ladder at a very young age and gain a lot of responsibility and gain a lot of like connections, or like overall, like rather than wasting off that Friday night to go drink and go to karaoke, stuff like that, you will study for like a degree for like TOEFL, or you learn another language, etc. So all in all, you won't be resting much, but you also be gaining a lot of things in the time that you have. \n\nAnd we think that this is very beneficial. First point, the unique thing about this being a norm is that like encourages people to work hard, right? So in the end, you don't need anybody to tell you to slack off, it's really easy for you to procrastinate, and to like not like to seek instant pleasure, because that's your like natural instinct. That's why you specifically need a norm that like suppresses your natural instincts, and tells you that it's important to work hard, it's important to have a long vision, like and to seek for your future and for like future dreams. Because like, this is something that really pushes you to work for like an uncertain future.\n\nWe told you, like as our first speaker told you, young people don't have the capability to look into a lot of things, and they're not like rational enough. And that's why it's really easy for them to prioritize that kind of partying or that instant pleasure. That's why we need a specific norm that goes against their natural instincts, and tells them that if you work hard right now, you'd be like, you'd be happy in the future. \n\nBecause right now, like we live in a world where people can live up to like 100 years, right? Like after you retire, and after all those like many, many decades that you're going to come, would you rather have like no money at all? Or would you rather have a lot of money saved, a lot of like connections built, like a lot of job opportunities that you gain in your life, etc. So overall, we think that like this widens your opportunities. So it really takes time for you to know what you really want, like your dream job, or like starting a company, for example. But once you do have that goal, it's really important that you have enough money, you know, you have enough connections to achieve what you really want to do. And you only learn these kinds of things by like trying different skills, or by talking with different people. So overall, because on our side, you gain more important life experiences, but you specifically need to have to make a habit while you are young, we're very proud to oppose."", 4: ""If we make more effort with long vision, the opportunity increases, and in the future, a possibility to enjoy more will increase. So we are happy to oppose.\n\nFirst, I will talk about why they have more harm and second, the crash point, immediate happiness or the future happiness and the importance.\n\nFirst, about why they have more harm. They were talking about they can't enjoy in the present situation and they have to feel more pressure, and they will think about only their individual profit. It's bad for society too. However, as our speaker said, if they only think about individual benefit, they will get more matter for health and also they will feel more importance with other people and those friends. Both of these affect the future. If we make more effort and get a good future or get a good job and those things, if we can make enough money, we can afford to be loved and make children and those things. \n\nAs our first speaker said, if we don't, this makes a habit of easy to give up. If this affects the future, their target, the people who have the opportunity to enjoy, they can't enjoy in the future because they have to suffer working with low wage and those hard work, and they will feel like health mental burden. They will lose room in mental. This connects to more lower birth rate because they are not enjoying their life in the future.\n\nNext, I will move on to the crush point. Today's clush point is immediate happiness or the future happiness. If we don't make an effort and just enjoy in the now, having fun with friends, only having fun and those things, they will have a low possibility to go to college. They can't get a job, and they will get a low wage, or they will suffer their life from 30s and 40s. They will have to suffer their rest of the life. They have to think about more of the money and those things. \n\nHowever, if we make an effort now, we can get more opportunity to go to a good university and have a good work, and it connects to good salary and stabilizes their life. They can enjoy the rest of their life. Even if they suffer a little when they are young, they can have fun when they are an adult and have a child or those things.\n\nThe importance is people tend to go to easy ways. If we make this customary from a young age, this habit will be forever. If we accord with norm, even if we feel a little harm in the short term, but if we make the effort in the future, the choice will, the opportunity will increase and the possibility of happiness will increase. Young age is like 20 years and 30 years, but in the future, we have to live 70 or 80 years. We must raise more awareness. We oppose this motion. Thank you."", 5: 'I think it is very easy to take rid of time regarded as needless. If you seek for the maximum profit of yourself, you can just stop making love with your girlfriend or making a relationship with your friends, and their true meaning. Because you cannot find any educational or social value by loving or making a relationship with her or him, and you can also say that, ""Oh, in order to get a higher status and job, I should overwork in the long term rather than prioritizing our health in the short term.""\n\nBut we think that these things cannot lead these young people to a better future. I definitely think that these things are just going to take rid of individual instinct choices or the individual\'s true choices, and we think that because we say that these kinds of idle times will be lost, we say that this kind of defining decade norm is going to harm us. So we think that we should think this motion which can lead people to a better future in a true meaning. So that is actually why we are going to oppose.\n\nOkay, but before moving on, I\'d like to do some rebuttals. Well, firstly, they have like four big failures. Firstly, they fundamentally neglect the premise of what they\'re supporting to protect.\n\nAnd secondly, if young people, they said that young people are irrational, but if the young people are irrational in a true meaning, then we think they\'re also going to likely to make terrible life goals, right? So we think that their life goal is going to be corrupted in the first place. \n\nAnd thirdy, there is no guarantee in the world to go to a good university and get good jobs. It depends on what you did for yourself, right? So it is not defined by fixed concepts or like that. So we think that these things are very needless.\n\nBut fourthly, they never prove that these kind of achieving life goals will always like success, right, in a true meaning. Well, we say that in order to like expand their views and for like prepare for these kind of like when you fail in some cases, we say that the idle time should be needed to expand your views like business or like experience or like various friends, not like those like business friends or like that. We think that we should make these kind of like friends in true meaning. That\'s actually why we\'re going to oppose.\n\nOkay, I\'d like to go to comparison. Okay, so what they said on mostly is that if you\'re going to have those kinds of norms, these kind of like people are going to have those like, I\'m not really sure about it, but rational mindset or like these people are going to have like better life goals and like go to like better universities or like that and like have a better life. But firstly, there is no guarantee that we\'re going to have a better life in a true meaning, right? Because they say they\'re like going to have this kind of like lifestyle is changing because we have like 100 years of life or like other things, but we say that because we have a long lifetime, we have to make more experience when we are young, right?\n\nWhen we are young, we can do a lot of things. We can make friends, not only like business friends, but we can also make friends like game friends or like other like comic friends or like other things. We say that the individual should have the right to make some kind of relationship with them and because it\'s going to vary through like emotions or like that too. \n\nBut in their paradigm, we think that these things are not going to happen, right? Because they already go pursue only for that social activities or like social values of it. We say that these friends are going to be corrupted, right? You\'re only going to think about these kind of like business friends, which is only on the surface place.\n\nBut secondly, we say that these kind of like other things, for example, for the policy is going to be corrupted because we say the policy will people only see for these kind of like long-term, and we say that these people are going to ignore the short-term benefit. That\'s actually why we\'re going to propose. Thank you.'}"
7,【gangの構成員を逮捕!？】mixidea高校定期練習【あんちゃん、野球やろっか】,THW criminalize gang membership.,"{0: ""We live in a world where you have around 10 people in the streets of Chicago or New York holding a gun or with a lot of tattoos on their body, perhaps even holding certain weapons. But the police isn't currently authorized to look after them or prosecute them based on the law, that it is not, like, not, it is okay for them to be a part of gangs because there's no evidence that they have committed a crime.\n\nWe think that the importance and the purpose of the criminal justice system is to not just prosecute current crimes. It is also to prevent and deter the occurrence and actions of crimes. And we say on the proposition that criminalizing gang membership is able to deter current crimes as well, but also future crimes, and we think that's the burden we have in this debate.\n\nHow do we define what a gang is? Three layers. First is that we think the gang is when a member collectively identifies and adopts a group identity, and they create an atmosphere of fear or intimidation. This could look like holding a lot of tattoos, Mr. Speaker, where you collectively identify through group tattoos or any kind of weapons or certain weapons or certain drugs. Secondly, we define what a gang is when the purpose is to literally pursue violence in a crime as a whole organization. And thirdly, we say that in the case that we criminalize gang membership and the police is able to prosecute certain members by identifying that they were part of a gang, we're happy to put them through extensive rehabilitation at the moment in which they still don't have deep ties with the gang yet. In case that they are deeply involved with the gangs, we'll make sure that they go through rehabilitation and they're not part of gang culture, such as in countries like America, and make sure that they cut absolutely every single tie with the gangs for the sake of crime.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm going to talk about three things. First, I'm going to talk about the criteria to criminalize. Secondly, I'm going to be talking about why this is a just and necessary policy. And thirdly, I'll be talking about why we decrease crime.\n\nQuickly, on terms of the criteria to criminalize, we say that if we prove this criteria applies for the sake of gang membership, we should take this debate. We think criminalization comes with two metrics. First, is that if we ensure that criminalization is able to deter the occurrence of crime. That's why, for instance, we criminalize guns in a lot of nations because we think that guns are deeply correlated with the actions of crimes, even when guns aren't literally the sake of crimes. But just because in terms of correlation, we think that when criminalization deters crime, we think that is okay. \n\nAnd secondly, we think it is important to protect the sustenance of society and make sure that society is a more safer and more sustainable place for innocent citizens to live on. If we prove that criminalizing gang membership is able to deter crime or prove that society is going to be a better place, we should take this debate.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm going to talk about my positive manner. First, let's talk about why this is a just and necessary policy. I have two layers in this argument. First, let me contextualize what gang members first do. We concede that membership does not equal violence, Mr. Speaker, but we say that gangs are inherently about committing violence and committing crimes.\n\nI think that the fact that you are trying to opt into this cycle, in this organization of violence, in and of itself, is self-indicative of the fact that you are interested in crime. That you want to commit crimes, or you want to steal someone, or you want to brutally murder someone, or you want to rape someone. I think the criminal justice system is there in order to prevent any incentive to commit crimes, and we think that on our side, it's more important to stop before actual casualties happen.\n\nHow do we see this in the current status quo? It comes like we prevent strangers from lurking around schools because just the fact that you might be a pedophile isn't necessary, and trying to prevent it before any kind of pedophile takes action on a children, in and of itself, is important. \n\nSimilarly, we think this is analogous to this motion because we say that in the case of gangs, we think just the fact that there are gangs is enough evidence that they're probably going to commit crimes in the future, and we want to prevent any kind of casualties from happening. We think that based on this, we think we should win. \n\nBut the second layer is that we think that there's many cases where usually youths or juveniles are coerced into this system. Given this, we think our side is going to be much better at preventing coercion. Why is this? Because we think the coercion by force, in and of itself, is firstly an unjust principle, that we should allow these people who have to coerce by using this illegality and this criminalization as an excuse to prevent entering these gangs in the first place. We think that given that youth and juveniles usually enter gangs because of this mild nuance that like, hey, being a part of a gang is cool, especially in countries like Mexico or Colombia, we are able to prevent this because we think that by the state in and of itself saying that gang membership is something illegal, that it is dangerous.\n\nWe think that youth and juveniles, first of all, won't have any incentives to go on, but secondly, they won't be able to be coerced as much because these other gang members know that they themselves are in a predicament where they can be arrested and have their futures taken away. So given this, we think that it is just and necessary because first, we have to prevent future crimes and deterrence. And I think that the fact that you are in a gang means that you're more likely to commit a crime than not doing so. \n\nAnd that the comparative is that it's too late on their side because you can only arrest gangs at the moment in which they do commit a crime, where there are actual casualties, where there's going to be raped victims, murdered victims, or any kind of casualties in general. Taken. All right.\n\n<POI> So if you're going to say that criminalizing is going to be a deterrent, why there are a lot of drug smugglers or doing other frauds, even you're a minor, and even you're going to be arrested if you did some of these kind of things, what do you think?\n\nLet me talk about my case about why we decrease crime, and I'm pretty sure that's going to be self-explanatory. Two layers. First, is that we actually reduce gangs in the first place. And I'm sure just in the POI, opposition might say it has no effect. The reason why this is effective is for two reasons. \n\nFirst is because I think the fact the state is saying that it is dangerous in and of itself is important. They talked about in the case of scams, but we're able to decrease that because we're saying that even trying to be a part of an organization that does scam in the first place is bad. Given in the status quo, there's not enough deterrence. We think our side is just like an enhanced version of this. \n\nBut secondly, it's because I think that on our side, like there's a lot of cases where police can't do anything, even when people are on motorcycles or holding bats. But on our side, we allow the police to prosecute them at any moment when they are suspect of being a gang. Why is this so important? Because we think organized crime is more important than individual crimes. The fact that youth and juveniles, this is going to be more like magnitude of crimes because just in terms of influence and money and authority, we think the gangs are much more dangerous. \n\nAnd this is the comparative that on their side, they can't do anything. They can only arrest people based at the moment in which they do commit a crime. We want to prevent future casualties and bury them."", 1: ""The government side talks that as if we're going to criminalize something, that all kinds of crime is going to be prevented. We think that these things, well, if we can do it, we think that it's good. But even now, in the present situation, even if you criminalize some kind of like drugs or drug smuggling or like fraud, it doesn't be a deterrent. Rather, it's going to say that these cases are going to increase on the case of like minors or others. And actually, we think that it's going to actually harm the society. That's actually why we're going to say that we should not criminalize gang star membership because we want to protect the future of the minors and others.\n\nAll right. Before going to our argument, I'd like to talk about, I'd like to say about two things. Well, firstly, they say that these kind of people who are a gang member, it's the people who are going to do future crime, to rebuttal here. Firstly, this is actually one of the stigmatization, right? If they say that as if all members of the gang member is going to commit a crime, we say that this is not true. Because there are a lot of people like the people who are doing like cooking or like others, it doesn't commit a crime. \n\nOr like, secondly, we say that other people, and secondly, we say that it is very vague until who you're going to punish. It is very vague for it. And we think it is unjust to punish something, even the criteria is very vague.\n\nWe'd like to go to our argument because we've finished our point. Alright. Going to our argument, we have three things to talk about. Firstly, we'd like to talk about the fundamental ideology of punishing individuals. Well, firstly, as our stance, we'd like to say that we are going to welcome punishing the gang members who committed the crime. We oppose punishing the gangs who didn't commit the crime. For example, the cooks or the people who are like cleaning the room or like, yeah, these people doesn't commit harm others or doesn't did something wrong. And some people also didn't know the truth that they like cleaned the room of the gangs or like death. So we think these things are unjust for three reasons.\n\nOne is that there are the cases that you didn't know, for example, the Yami Egiro Mondays or like other cases. Even these people don't know. We think that some kind of like cooks or like other people are going to like be criminalized because you did something for the gangs or like other things in their paradigm. Right. We think that it is ridiculous because they did nothing wrong. They didn't kill anybody. They didn't rape somebody or like death. But they're going to be punished. We think that it is unjust.\n\nSecondly, we say that the criteria and criteria is very big. So we think that it's going to isolate these people because if we say like other people want to help these like people who are in the gang and they want to go out of the gang. However, if these people are going to like help these individuals in the gang, maybe the police are going to have those like stigmatization that the people who are related to these like gang members or have the possibility of being a gang membership, we think that these people have the possibility to be punished. And because of this, the other people are going to have more hardship to help these people. Right. We think that because of this, we think it is actually not going to be a deterrent, but rather these people are going to be in these like gangs and no one is going to help them. We think it is. It is very harmful.\n\nActually, the third reason is that principally we think that if you're if you did something wrong, we think that these people should not be punished. For example, if you did something, if you didn't kill somebody or if you didn't do some kind of crime, we think that these individuals should not have any kind of any kind of like punishment or like death. Right. And people have the right to have and have the right to not to have like criminalization or like others.\n\nWe would like to talk in our second point. All right. Our second point is the rehabilitation just needs to infect the underlying and underling to cause more crime. All right. So firstly, now in the present situation, we say that the rehabilitation just just for these individuals to do more like work or like the simple work or like other things. And it's not going to be a fundamental solution for this. Right. And moreover, we think it is causing more harm because even though even now there are two people. One is the people who have rehabilitated. Second is the people who had not rehabilitated. Even they did all the terms of the rehabilitation. We think that these two people are existing.\n\nHowever, even though there are these two people, these like the companies or the corporations are not going to accept these people because they're going to prioritize the main value or other things. And we say that these profit speakers are going to know, going to try to see what kind of crime, what kind of things they didn't have, including these like criminal records. So actually, if they become an applicant, these corporations, it's actually not taking, not going to adapt these people into their companies.\n\nActually, this rehabilitation is not working well. This means that these people are going to be excluded from society. What's going to happen? We say that these criminals are going to have more unionized cases and they are going to do more crimes because they don't have any weight or like any kind of like work that we think that these people have more possibilities, that they're going to commit more crimes, more or like make more like organized crimes or like organized gangs. And actually, we think that this is going to make a vicious cycle, which leads to more crimes because these organized gangs are going to do more crimes because they want to have money like drug smuggling or like others. And we think that it is very harmful.\n\nAnd surely we like to talk that how these things, it's not going to, and even now, even though they are going to criminalize, we think that this is not going to be a fundamental solution because if it's going to be something like an organized crime now or like in the future, we think that the people who are going to be arrested, it's only these like the underling, which is the lower position people who have this, who are the minors or like who are the low position members. And we think that these people are going to be arrested. But if it's going to be an organized crime, it is very hard for to know who is the top leader or where is the top leader now. And we think that because of this, these people are going to put all of these crimes to these lower members people, and these lower members people are going to make more crimes in the future.\n\nThat's actually why we're going to say that these things are not never going to be solved, and it's going to increase the crime. That's actually why we're going to oppose. Thank you."", 2: ""So first, I'd like to state the purpose of taking this motion. So, why we want to criminalise? It is not because we want to exile the criminals or the gangs from the society, but our purpose is to help those criminals or the gangs rehabilitate and get back to the normal society. And the second purpose is to prevent the future crimes. So, that is our purpose.\n\nAnd also, the opposition side said that the criteria for determining the gangs is vague. However, as the first piece of clearly explained, what gangs are, and which is that the group, which is the gangs, is the group where they encourage both directly or indirectly committing crimes. And because of this clear criteria, the judge, we think that the judge is also capable of determining whether a group belongs to the categorisation of a gang.\n\nAnd, okay, so next, I'd like to revert to the opposition side's claim that this motion will not act as the deterrent. Well, even though the opposition side said so, as the first speaker clearly showed, there is a clear step that, by taking this motion, gangs will decrease and then eventually the crime number will decrease. And even if we hypothesise that it will not have direct results, such as the decrease of the crime, we believe that it is very important for a country to clearly show their stance.\n\nSo, currently, the government stance is very vague. And even though they criminalise the action that the gangs take, they haven't directly banned the gangs itself. However, as we all know, the police are always trying to disassemble those gangs by trying to find those crimes that they commit. So, there's this contradiction between the government and the police. Even though the government doesn't directly say that the gangs are out of law, the police is taking action that clearly shows that gangs are not under the law. And this is creating a confusion within the public, especially to the juvenile, as our first speaker briefly mentioned.\n\nBecause the government is standing on an unstable and unclear stance, the public do not have this strong understanding that being a gang member is a crime. But if we take this motion, this will change. Because, well, we know that murdering someone is a crime without conscience, and there's no doubt within it. Because we know, because the government is clearly stating that it is a crime to kill someone.\n\nAnd so, this will apply similarly to this case too. And if the government clearly shows that being a gang member is a crime, even the youngs will eventually know and understand clearly that being a gang member is a crime. And by establishing this circumstance, we'll be able to decrease the number of youngs getting into the gangs, because they think that being a gang member is cruel. So, we believe that it is very important for the government to state their stance, even if we think that this motion will not have a direct effect.\n\nAnd also, it may be questionable whether a gang member actually committed a crime. Well, it is true that not every single member of gangs does not commit a crime. However, if we compare the possibility of committing a crime between a gang member and a non-gang member, it is apparent that the gang member has a higher possibility of committing a crime. \n\nAnd the government's job is to... As I clearly stated in the beginning of my speech, our purpose is to prevent the future crimes. And by banning the action that comes before committing a crime, which is becoming a gang member, we'll be able to decrease the number of crimes, even if we're not sure whether the person is actually going to commit a crime after being a gang member. So, for these reasons, we propose this motion. Thank you."", 3: ""So, before I would like to move on to the rebuttal, I would like to add two more arguments. First of all, I would like to make an argument that it is difficult to draw lines that who is a gang member or not. And secondly, I would like to make an argument about the invitation.\n\nAs for the first argument, nowadays it is too difficult to draw lines on who is a gang member or not. Even if the gang organization and a person who made a contract or has the same tattoo in one organization and becomes a member, it is difficult to know who is a member because they will hide that he or she made a contract or hide the tattoo. Police cannot search enough evidence that the person is a member or is a gang member. So, it is difficult to invest and arrest them. \n\nThen, does it have real meaning to regulate or crack down by taking this motion? No, right? Even if we take this motion, we cannot find a person who is a member. So, even if we take this motion, we cannot have real meaning to achieve their purpose.\n\nSecondly, about the invitation. Firstly, they have a bias that gang members commit crimes. But this is not true, right? These days, many people have been invited by strange religion at the university or some other places and become a member of that, right? And this is a problem mostly in Japan. Those people have almost never mind to become a member, right? Because they will have interest by their, like, not, like, they might have, like, saying something about good for themselves by some strange religion. \n\nBut this happens the same in the invitation of gang organization, right? Because gang wants a member to expand their activity. So, if we take this motion, we have to criminalize these people who have less or no feeling to commit a crime, commit crimes, or even become a member of the gang, right? \n\nSo, we have to, the government has to protect them because they are almost victims. Gang wants a member to expand their activity. So, they might, they will invite many people that they want a member of our organization. And maybe, or definitely, they said the member of the gang, gang member will say this organization is not a bad organization. So, if we take this motion, these cases will occur so many times. So, we can't protect them by taking this motion.\n\nWe would like to move on to the rebuttal and a little bit of reconstruction. First of all, they think that they can decrease criminals by taking this motion, and they can prevent crimes by taking this motion. But there are lots of gang organizations, and by taking this motion, we might criminalize the member of the gang, a few. But this is much harm more, like, because these people who are arrested mostly are in the low position, as the first speaker has said. So, they have less will to do crimes than people who are in the top of the organization. \n\nAnd they, and sometimes the people who are in the low position have strong will, but the less will, the people who have less will are existed. So, if those people are in the prison, those people or more wicked people are in the prison, right? So, we think we cannot put them who has the member of the gang in their old life, right? So, they will return to the society in the future.\n\nAs the first speaker has explained, if we take this motion, we will make the network between criminals by having a community with them, right? So, they said that by taking this motion, it is very safe and sustainable, but if we take this motion, will the crime decrease? No, right? Not, because they will make a network and know what's the crime or what's the good way to do crimes by not to know by the police or something like that. So, this occurs that people commit crimes again. \n\nSo, their purpose was to prevent future crimes, but our side is more better, because as I said that it is important way or exacting way to protect this society by taking this, but even if you take this motion, we can't eradicate the real organization. That's the first speaker has to say, right? So, for this reason, we would like to oppose. Thank you."", 4: ""Opposition made the one fundamental mistake that an opposition side cannot do. That is, that they failed in providing a counterfactual, where in their world, gangs are still going to exist, where there's still going to be violent gangs, and how on their side, they are able to uniquely decrease crime. All we got was that, oh, that the concept of gang is very vague, very subjective, but we think that there was no actual critical feedback or any kind of rebuttal coming to a bulk of violent, like the majority of gangs which are violent on our side, how we decrease crimes, and we think the moment in which they failed to provide a counterfactual, they lost this debate.\n\nI'm going to be talking about two issues. First is about the bulk of their argument, which was about this metric of what a gang is. Secondly, I'm going to be talking about which side is able to prevent the occurrence of crimes, and I'm going to be talking about this in a couple of layers.\n\nFirst, in terms of metric, opposition fundamentally failed in explaining and replying to the majority of the bulk of our argument in our metric, which was that there are a lot of violent gangs, like the Crips and Bloods in LA, or Sinaloa cartels in Mexico, whose literal intent is to commit crimes and create a community of violence. The fact that they didn't respond to this is a concession that these gangs are dangerous, and that we have to stop them, and they concede that in the case of violent gangs, it is necessary to criminalize gang membership. And at the moment in which they failed in replying to any of our argument about this community of violence, we think they dropped our argument that gangs are fundamentally dangerous and that we ought to prosecute them.\n\nBut secondly, is that the only reply we got was that there could be gangs that clean up rooms. I think this is a pretty inaccurate description of what a gang is, right? I think the only time these gangs are going to clean up a room is when they murdered someone in the room and they're having to clean it up. But let's assume that these gangs can be so fluffy that maybe their only intent is to hold a tea party and just eat cookies. Let's take this. But we think that this argument still neglects the premise and the incentive of these members who want to enter gangs.\n\nWe think the incentive of these gang members is to commit violence, are to commit crimes. Youths who are potentially cursed or youths who are just interested in this slavish ways of violence and crimes. We think that if you want to just clean up rooms, it's much better on the counterfactual, where on our side, we're still going to provide things like regulated government offices where if you want to clean up stuff, you can enter the Red Cross or UNICEF. And I think this is much better on their side, regardless of what incentive there is. It's better than some unregulated, potentially dangerous, unorganized group. We think that counterfactual is good.\n\nLook, the comparison is that even if it is vague, that is not a reason why you have to oppose criminalization. Although, for instance, we do criminalize hate speech in a lot of countries, even if the metric of hate is pretty subjective and vague, we think that this ignores opposition. The reason why we are able to criminalize gangs, even if it is vague, because we think on our side, we include courts in the equation of criminalization, which opposition absolutely neglected. That is that we think the courts are able to at least determine what is violence and what is not through the legislative procedure. And that's why we're able to criminalize hate speech.\n\nAnd we think this mirrors the logic, and we think that we're able to criminalize gang membership because we do have this final barrier that is able to determine what is violence, what is not. And I gave you a very explicit model in the first place of what a gang is, so it simply wasn't enough. And therefore, 50-minute speeches absolutely drops because this metric of vagueness is not a reason to oppose the criminalization of gang membership. Just in the same way that we have to look at incentive, and we prosecute attempted murder and not murder, but the intent of committing murder is in and of itself important. So the incentive of committing crimes is enough reason of criminalizing gang membership in the first place. Therefore, we think that their whole argument falls.\n\nLet's look at the more important question then, the occurrence of criminalization. Opposition told us three things. First, they told us that companies were important. I'm going to look at this in a lot of ways.\n\nFirstly, we think that in the counterfactual, gangs are going to exist. Given that gangs are going to exist, we think that companies have a certain right to know whether they were a gang member or not. Look, just imagine the top gang of Mexico, which is the Sinaloa Cartel, to be a part of a company of a gun shop, Mr. Speaker. We think that in these cases, they're still going to be much worse because companies don't know they're hiring literal criminals inside their pretty dangerous organization, which holds, handles weapons, for instance. Or just imagine an organization of scammers, of a gang that only commits thieves and burglaries to enter a very important finance company, we think, like Golden Saks, right?\n\nWe think that's bad because companies have a certain right to know that they have to protect other employees who are not gangs, and on their side, we think that it's simply, we think that it's good that companies do know if they're gangs or not because that's literally the point of criminalization, right, to ensure the benefit of society. They weren't able to engage with this.\n\nHowever, let's say that we still want these criminals to employ these ex-convicts, right? Why is this better on our side? Because we think just in the same way we do for juveniles, we could just hide their identity up, that is, that we don't allow criminal, like, companies to give access to criminal records, and on our side, we're telling you that we're going to give rehab, job training, and community sentencing. We think this is more than enough incentive for companies to employ them in the first place. They weren't able to give a counterfactual, and thirdly, I'm going to prove to you why on their side, they aren't able to, like, have effective rehabilitation.\n\nWhy is this the case? Because under their side, when these gang members enter prison, they're still deeply tied with gangs, that is, that they have to stay with gangs to survive, especially in countries like America or Colombia, where most, like, most prison inmates are usually gang members, so they're forced to hold ties with gangs, they're forced into a community of hatred and violence, and we think just in terms of broken window theory, which is that if you are in a community of violence, you're more likely to commit violence, we think that rehabilitation isn't effective, because you still have to, you're surrounded by a lot of people who commit crimes.\n\nJust in the same way that if you're holding an anger management class, but you're literally forced into this gang or gang community and seeing, like, a lot of fights every day, we think that rehabilitation isn't effective. On our side, we told you, so we separate them from these groups because we, like, we take them out of the equation of gangs, the moment in which they try to enter, so they still don't have deep ties with these gang members yet, therefore, we're able to prevent them from holding deep ties and allowing them a better integrating society by having a lot of rehabilitation, so we think that in terms of rehabilitation and reintegrating society, we do it better on our side.\n\nLook, the failure of opposition was that they weren't able to provide any reason why, like, the whole existence and allowing and accepting gang members to be in society is actually able to deter crime. We told you explicitly one. I'm very happy for this."", 5: ""So first, I'm going to rebuttal the government's side. The government side said that we can hide criminal records, but even if we hide the criminal records, the company cares about profit seeking, and the company's main value. And so, after all, they don't employ employees, so this is not true. And also, we can ask support to detectives or experts, and we can ask the criminal records. So, this is not true.\n\nThen, I'm talking about the arraignment of our issues. First, the government side said that if we take this motion, we can prevent future crime, and protect the society, we're safer. But we think that if we take this motion, young members are must be rehabilitated by punishment. So, in this situation, they may contain the more bad group, and we can know about how to escape those agreements. And we think that they can think of a wiser way to escape this. \n\nAnd this is bad effect for society more than to take this motion. And which is better, to prevent crime before they do, or not prevent at that time, but after more bigger crime can be saved. I think that not take this motion is more safety for society. And take this motion is less bad effect for society. Because, I told before, we are company, we become a bad company in the gang member. And so, this is bad effect for society anymore.\n\nAnd the opposition side also said, if we take this motion, even if we take this motion, we can only find weak gang members. Because, the government side said that government and police officers connection is strong, so we can find gang members really. But, this is not true, because to find those gang members is difficult, because they know how to escape this. And we are always thinking about how to escape that.\n\nSo, after all, we can only find weak or not big gang members. So, this is not solve the whole of gang members' crime, and not effect for the future at all. So, not taking this motion is more good effect for society. And also, rehabilitation is give bad effect for them. So, we do not take this motion."", 6: ""The government side mostly talks about three things. One is that the government should have the staff to oppose gang members, and it is important. But we, and secondly, they say that even, and secondly, they say that we should protect these kind of like societies rather than these individuals. And surely they say that even these kind of like gang members, the ex-gang members are going to be isolated in the societies rather it is better. We actually oppose to these three things.\n\nAlright, why our side is better? We like talking our point. Well, firstly, we actually told us that, we actually listened to them, that why should we prioritize government staff rather than these kind of like retribution or like other things, right? Because we say the retribution, or we say the retribution is just the thing that even there is no like victims or other people, there is no reason that we have to prioritize like other things. Rather we say that we should like prioritize these like rehabilitation of the individuals or like that. We are going to talk about why our side is better. Alright.\n\nAnd before that, I'd like to do one rebuttal. Well, even now, the government is saying that being gang members corrupts our lives, or we have some kind of like posters or like other things. Why these individuals are not having like, are still going to be like gang members or other things? Because, and it's their thing that if these kind of like posters or other things are being noticed, and all things, it's going to change. What is the difference between criminalizing or like other things? We don't think that there is a clear difference, because even the minors are now doing like drug smuggling, and it is increasing every year. And actually, even if it's a crime, these individuals are going to do because they want to have money or like other, like fame for others. That's actually why we are going to think that this is not going to be solved.\n\nAlright. Moving to our argument, we actually told you three things. One is the rehabilitation moves well or not. Well, actually, they didn't really engage on this point. And actually, they admitted that this rehabilitation is not going to work well, and the corporation or like other organizations are not going to be employed. Alright. And even, and one thing they say is that, well, all right, well, the government can prohibit to have like those criminal, to notice those criminal records of these like companies or like others. But actually, we think that it is very, it is impossible, because these like, as our week speaker told you, that these kind of like companies or corporations, they are profit seekers, and they're just going to know about these criminal records from like other people, from the third person. And we think that it is inevitable. And we think that it's unjust.\n\nSecondly, we say that even we're going to like criminalize, sorry, secondly, we're going to say that it is going to, if this kind of like rehabilitation is not going to work, how these individuals are going to, going to like move for society. We say that if you're not going to be in society, and you're going to be isolated, rather these people are going to be a gang member again, to commit crime, because this is the only way that you're going to live, we think that these things are not going to be solved, rather it's going to be more radicalized, and the individuals, the minors who want to have money or like other like things, who are going to be inside these groups, and rather we say that these kind of crimes is going to increase, never going to be solved in their paradigm too, because there is no rehabilitation. That's actually why we're going to say it's harmful, and because the site is going to be harmed too.\n\nAnd thirdly, we say that because these like organizations are not going to like fundamentally harm, and so we say that people who are doing like crips or like other people are going to have infected, they're going to be more a gang, and actually we think these things are going to increase more crimes, more things in society, which means that these organized crimes are going to be going to have more, which is going to harm the society, which they want to say, so actually their stance is very vague, because our site is going to say that there is more harm to them. Thank you."", 7: ""First of all, I'd like to clarify that the burden in our side was not to prove that we eradicate all crimes, but to prove that to a certain extent, the number of crimes will decrease.\n\nFirst, I'd like to rebuttal to what the opposition side has said. They said that there are drug smugglers, but we can see that they'll presumably exist on both sides and mutually exclusive. And what we're talking about is domestic gangs who usually hide violent and criminal activities and act tough in public with the police, unable to prosecute them until there's going to be victims. \n\nAnd the question raised in this debate was, is this motion going to increase or decrease crimes? The opposition side failed to explain how the status quo would decrease the number of crimes compared to the motion. However, we showed that even if criminals make a more complicated network, this motion will be effective because gangs already have this network. But after plan, it will become easier for the police to catch those networks because the police's capability of finding crimes will be bigger and therefore leading to a more effective way of catching criminals.\n\nIf the opposition side was so worried about catching those who haven't committed crimes, then new gang members who want to show that they're innocent shouldn't act tough in public. And our goal is to reduce the number of crimes such as scams and frauds. And why does it specifically have to be this motion? Because gangs are almost always committing crimes and many get away with committing crimes like frauds. And if we let them join a gang, the power of gangs will only get bigger and stronger and better with getting away with crimes.\n\nAnd we think that the opposition side is too optimistic about the reality. Every year many criminals get away with committing scams and frauds and if we retain the status quo, this situation is not going to get any better. And we on the other hand understand how serious this situation is and how this motion would help the gangs rehabilitate and learn about how they could actually earn money without damaging other people in society. And we also want to say that because to compare the status quo and the motion, we want to say that the damage done to gangs is smaller than the damage done to their victims. As we said, we understand how serious the situation is and we want to decrease the number of victims as much as possible. And this motion will help decrease the number of victims, therefore we're superior.""}"
8,【mixidea高校定期練習】 May's Tournamement優勝候補 vs 富士見高校+第五,TH prefers a world where adult children take in their elderly parents rather than support them to live separately.,"{0: ""Speaker, the elderly of the current status quo are condemned to a life that is not lifed, where they await isolation and sadness without a sense of fulfillment until death. We support this motion.\n\nNote two things before I begin my set of answers. First, is that this is not a policy debate. We think this is a comparison of benefits of harms to elderly and both children. But secondly, granted that opposition might attack the feasibility saying that this is impossible. We say that we characterize adult children as around 35 to 40, where they have extra income, where they have a stable life. We say this is going to be more than capable of having parents move in. We say this is going to be better for two reasons. Two substantive in my point. First is upon why this is good for elderly. And secondly, why this is good for children.\n\nLet's talk about a first argument. Why is this good for elderly? But before I talk about that, let's characterize what the elderly really need. What they don't need is material consideration because they already have pension fees. They already have money built up from a young age. What they actually need is fulfillment, a care and emergency responses, especially in the age where you are likely to have more health issues or more mental issues. We think that when they live where their husband or wife might have passed away, they might have Alzheimer's. They're isolated away. We think what these elderly require the most in terms of practical is a sense of fulfillment. And we say our side is able to better prove that.\n\nBefore explaining why a world is better, two likely cases upon opposition. That is first is that under their side, they're likely to send elderly to retirement homes. The reason why this doesn't provide a sense of fulfillment is because these retirement homes are usually consisted of workers who only care about getting money. That means that if they're fed up, they're only going to give you the bare minimum. They're not going to care how their day was. But even if that these workers were able to provide the sense of fulfillment, we say that they're less likely and less susceptible to treat any kind of mental or health issues of these parents, just because the ratio of these workers to the number of elderly, especially in this world of aging population and a lack of nursery homes are proven. That's why we say that in the retirement homes, this is going to be impossible. \n\nBut secondly, we say that in the case, the best case scenario that we assume that the child can assume and invest and get these elderly their own house. The reason why this won't work is because these elderly still won't get enough care. That is the parents don't want to bother children with their issues. They don't want to care because they already feel bad about getting their own house. They're going to love you and assume you're busy. That's why if you have back pain, you won't tell your children. And at this point, we say that issues are more likely to become too late to respond to. We think there's going to be a little world in turn, possibly even death, whether injuries or any kind of damage is untreated.\n\nWith this in mind, why is our world better? Three reasons. First is because when you live together, you're going to be more comfortable sharing your issues. You're more likely to talk to these elderly about their days or problems when you live together and see communication over the dinner table, for instance. \n\nBut secondly, even if there wasn't any kind of direct sense of communication, we see that you're physically able to see their kind of issues since you're up close to them. So at the point when you see that they're limping or any kind of coughing extravagantly, we say that you can send them to hospital and make sure that they're going to be okay at a more urgent pace than opposition side. We say that you're able to provide more affection and love on our side. \n\nBut thirdly, we say our side is better because distance creates apathy. You see them less, they become a secondary consideration that when you go there, it's just going to be a two-hour visit, which it was kind of an obligation, right? So in our side, you make sure that the relationships between the elderly and the child become primary considerations. They care about each other the most.\n\nWhy do we get better fulfillment? It's two reasons. First is because we say that we provide a sense of fulfillment because the elderly can watch their grandchild raise up or watch their own child be independent and go on with their lives. We say this is going to be much better. But secondly, is that the problem of the status quo in retirement homes is all the old people do is they just watch TV all day or just play bingo with their elderly friends. This is problematic because this is usually the reason why they don't have any kind of sense of living. This is one of the reasons why many people say elderly are more likely to feel depressed because they don't do anything productive. On our side, we look for things for elderly to do, such as interacting with grandchildren on a daily basis, perhaps cooking or doing any kind of more chores to help out the family. We say that in terms of fulfillment, our side is better. So to weigh this is that elderly people want fulfillment. We provide them, unlike opposition, where because of our likely cases that are analyzed, this is impossible for opposition's case. \n\nSecondly, why is this going to be better for children? Two reasons. First is that we open up important opportunities for women or single parents who are unable to afford nannies or cannot afford babysitters. That means that they're not able to take the jobs they want to take. They have to quit jobs they want to participate because they have to take care of their child and stay at home. At this side, we say that it's much better because women are able to seek help from parents. The parents are staying home. And instead of perhaps like affording some kind of stranger or some kind of shady babysitter, you're able to ask your parents for help to look after your grandchild. We think this is going to be better for both elderly because they could look after their grandchild. You're going to provide seek and affection, but also good for the child themselves because they can have their own child looked after.\n\nBut secondly, is that they won't feel a sense of regret. Is that we think that in the status quo, these children usually feel regret, not feeling depressed because they weren't able to do what they could have done when their parents might have had an injury at a retirement home when they couldn't find out their injuries during the two-hour visit of an obligation. We think these can often be the stamp for suicide or differentiation. For instance, we take care of mental health and prevent any kind of regret happening.\n\nNow, we understand opposition is going to probably come up here with like some kind of likely case that these parents are going to impose social norms. So this isn't going to be true. It's not going to be good. Given that they say this, three rebuattals. First, is that parents who are extreme traditionalists will usually do this on both sides and do this from a young age. So this point wouldn't be really mutually exclusive. \n\nBut secondly, is that this isn't susceptible because since they're parents now, we think they will have decent footing with one other. It's unlikely that the elderly would just be super mean and angry and dominant over an adult child. \n\nBut thirdly, we think it's better to resolve these conflicting implications by living together. So if a child is gay, it's better to show that they're gay by living a comfortable life with them instead of just saying that the gay child is fine during a two-hour visit. At this point, we say our side is better for a world where both sides seek benefits. I'm happy to propose."", 1: ""Opposition side thinks that supporting their parents should be the proper aid. So today, we strongly oppose this motion.\n\nSo first, let me explain the model. And second, I want to explain why we are leaving. Second, I will explain the rebuttal. And third, I want to explain why leaving the superlative is good for the self-actualization for the children. And finally, I want to explain why it's also good for the parents.\n\nSo first, let me explain our model. So in the opposition side, of course, think that taking care of the parents is a very good thing. So we agree at this point. However, we think that taking care of the parents is, of course, good for the parents. However, it should also be good for the children. So we strongly oppose. So in our role, even if the children cannot live with the parents, we can support their parents. It is because they can support by the financial. So in the current situation, sometimes the parents cannot have enough money, only the pension. So our side, the children can help by the financial. So for example, if the parents want to hire a helper, the children can pay money instead of their parents. And secondly, even if they leave the superlative, of course, they can meet once a month. No, thank you. So they can also meet even if they are on our side.\n\nSo second, let me attack their point. They said that they could talk and live together. It is not always true because children can't talk if parents have dementia. This puts stress on the children and burdens them. And we will explain this point by my second speaker.\n\nSo let me move on to why living separately is good for self-actualization for the children. So we have the three ways.\n\nSo first point. First is that if the government side, they have the restriction of the time because the children want to care and children want to care their parents. So that means that they have to fix their parents' lifestyle. So that means that the children cannot enough their working or their hobby. Because, for example, maybe their children's wake-up time and their parents' wake-up time is different. And of course, the children worry about their parents can't meet only themselves. So they worry about it. So that means that they have to fix their parents' lifestyle.\n\nAnd second point is emotional cost. So the care to care to their parents is a very hard work. So sometimes they cannot communicate not easily. So that's connected to the mental stress. And so this is a very bad thing. \n\nAnd so and on the contrary, why we can guarantee freedom for children. So then, however, in opposition, we don't have any restriction of the time because we live in the separate. So they can continue to work and they can continue the things that they want to do. And of course, the emotional cost is reduced. So that means that they can live freely in the government side. And as I said, the two, the opposition side thinks that locally is very important. So that point. Sorry. So it is better than the government side.\n\nAnd there also this our opposition side is the good for the parents because we think the parents can be independent, and children can keep supporting. So the first day in a pleasant situation, parents is not in a future. So they become in the old that children supported them. So that means that they give up to become in the older and order to be low their functions. So children don't do it for it.\n\nHowever, in our position side, parents will require only financial order remotely support. So that means that they have to do. They have to do a lot of work or a lot of things, even if they become in the old so that they don't give up. So that's really true. Their function is still OK. So it is also good.\n\nAnd in addition, maybe there are children is a very worldly about their parents. So that means that sometimes is that parents is to extremely depend on their children. However, I think that, as I said, to training their function is a very important. So the hours, our arguments want to say that in the opposition side can can parents more and more independent. So it is also good for the parents. So we propose we oppose this motion."", 2: ""The elderly that we are talking about do not need money. They do not need financial aid because they already have financial aid from other things like pension and so on. What we think is the most important for these elderly parents to live a fulfilling life is to have like emotional fulfillment, to be comfortable in their own homes, and be able to do things that they enjoy even in their later lives. We think that this sort of emotional support is more important than anything that the opposition can provide, which is only financial support. We think that the children are the only actors that can provide this sort of support for the parents. That is why we are very proud to propose this motion. \n\nSo, three things in my speech. First, about which is better for the children. Second, about whether the elderly need the support from children. Third, about how relationships are bettered under our world. My refutations are incorporated into my points.\n\nFirst, about children. Opposition gave us mainly two points. They told us that they'll have to adapt to their parents' lifestyles and that's going to be a burden for the children. Two responses. First of all, this isn't true because they told us about how these children will have to wake up at the same time as their parents and so on. We think that's untrue. You can just wake up at separate times. You can create a timetable to figure out how to fit your schedules together and so on. \n\nSecond, they talked about how having parents who have dementia and so on is going to be a huge burden. We think that in the case of elderly who have extreme illnesses and so on, they will obviously have doctors to look over their health or their mental health and so on. We don't think that that burden is going to be completely on the children. Most of their health problems will be solved by, for example, obviously they'll have doctors visiting their house or they'll go to daily checkups and so on. We think that that sort of burden of checking on their health is not necessarily all on the children. We say that that sort of burden is not going to be huge in the first place.\n\nSecond of all, they told us about the emotional burden that these children face, that they're going to be worrying about their parents. We think that that's going to happen on either side. These children are going to be worried about their parents. On opposition, we say that rather that's worse because their parents are going to be far away from them, like in a completely different prefecture, for example, in an extreme rural area where there's no one around them. They're going to be extremely worried about their parents' health. They're going to be worried about how their parents are letting up in that situation. We think that that burden is much worse. It's much better under our side when they can actually check up on these parents daily. We think that that worry is going to be less under our side. \n\nWe think that even if there's going to be an extreme emotional burden, we think that in the long run, as our first speaker told you, there's going to be less emotional burden on these children. Because these children in the long run will be unlikely to, for example, regret not helping their parents. We think that these children are indebted to their parents because their parents raised them. But if they leave them to, for example, if they leave them in a retirement home or live extremely far away from them, and they become emotionally or physically isolated, and they die as a result and so on, they're going to have this regret for the rest of their lives. We think that that is an emotional burden that they have under their side as well. In the long run, they're going to be less burdened under our side. \n\nFurthermore, we think that it's much better for children under our side, because if you live close to them, you're more likely to be able to help them if your parents need help. We think that the sort of worry or emotional burden is actually much worse under the opposition.\n\nBut second of all, let's talk about the elderly, right? Do the elderly actually need the physical proximity to their children? So basically, what opposition told us is that all of the support that the elderly need can be done financially, right? But we don't think this is true. And we told you this from our very first speaker, right? Financial aid is not what the elderly people need or what they want. We think that what they need is emotional fulfillment. \n\nAnd we think that the only actor that can provide that are the children. Because we told you from on the physical level, how it's much easier to, for example, talk about a health issue that you have, or something that you're struggling with as a parent to someone that you're comfortable talking to, which is someone that you've lived with all your life, which is someone who you actually trust, right? Whereas if you're talking to like, if you're talking to someone from someone from like a retirement home, it's much harder for you to speak up about these issues. And we also told you about how there's going to be emotional fulfillment, right? If you're left in a retirement home, you're going to be like spending every day just watching other old people play bingo. Whereas in, under our side, these elderly can actually see their parents, their children or their grandchildren grow up, and so on. And we say that the sort of emotional fulfillment is what these people need. \n\n<POI>As we are exactly enjoying right now, the attachment can be gained not offline, but also online by zoom video chatting or Skype video chatting. Why this alternative is not good enough.\n\nAbout how these, these elderly parents need the physical help in like, within like health issues, first of all, but second of all, we also think that like, this physical proximity is important, right? Because if, if, like, we think that it's like, extremely unlikely that these children, we think that if you live extremely far apart, people are less like, these children are less likely to like check up on their parents, like over zoom or over like, over text and so on. Because first of all, the elderly are can't use the electronics as well as the children. But second of all, we think that these children will have to go out of their way to do so. And we think that this sort of physical proximity is important. \n\nAnd going on to how relationships are better under our world, we think that under oppositions world, if people if these children and the parents live separately, if they have disagreements, there's a physical barrier, and it's likely that they will stop seeing, seeing each other if they have a disagreement, and so on. But rather under government side, we think that these disagreements can be resolved in that moment, and people will be more likely to be able to resolve them, because they have that physical proximity, because they have to do that, because they live inside the same household. \n\nWe think that generational differences can also be like bridged under our side, because these the elderly will like will be less isolated will be less isolated in like an extremely rural environment. And they'll be able to like, understand these generational differences, understand maybe learn how to use electronics, or like learn these societal norms that have changed, and so on. And we think that overall, this relationship between like these intergenerational communication is bettered, and the relationship of the children and the parents are bettered overall under our side, very proud to propose."", 3: ""We can support for the elderly. Even if children can't live together, because children can use things like IT or SNS or money support, we can do it. So I will oppose this motion.\n\nFirst of all, I will debate the argument. Second, I will explain about harm, like living with children's harm and living together with parents. And the second is changing the society to support the parents.\n\nSo first of all, I will rebut the argument. So they said that as South speakers touched on the point, they said like emotional support, they can do emotional support. However, it is no uniqueness because we can use IT and SNS. We can do video calling and we can do even if they can't, they can live together.\n\nAnd so I will explain about children's harm to live together with parents. As the first speaker told you like time management and children will be tired, and it is a very serious point. So I will support this argument. So the younger have to take care of their parents, like their age is like 20s or 30s and so on. But, however, if we know or prefer this world, the children can work more and more. They can live free pressure. However, if we prefer this world, children have to, if the parents' support is very become burden, the children have to quit their work because it is very serious physical or mental burden. So why is it very serious? Because if the children feel very burden, they will, if they feel burden, they can't contact the outside because it is the family's problem. So it will lead to suicide. So it is a very serious point. \n\nAnd on the other hand, our argument is very superior because helpers or helpers facility is very good because they are very specialist and they can have a long term experience and they can be best case support. For example, male's nutrition or they can do exercise with the elder. So it is very good because the elder's body can retain good and their lifestyle can be retained mainly because the professional can support it. And their benefit is like physical safety for the elderly. However, it is not always true because elderly sometimes suffer because of care and neglect and even sometimes is bullying. So it is very serious for elderly and it is very serious for children and the parents because they will be tired more and more.\n\nSo, and the second is like a society's change. So why it is very, why this motion is happen? Because it is a family's norm. So it is very problem, like family's norm, because this tendency is very serious for society. Because first is we can't spend money for social security, security. For example, for example, a housing home and so on. And governments can't, can't, don't have to need to, need to support money because, because governments retain the children. So it is a very burden for children.\n\nHowever, if we support them to live separately, so burden, we can solve the burden problem and children can support, support and society will, can support to live, to live the elderly. So, so if, if the children are married, get married, they can't, they will be harder to live their just life. So as my reason, I will oppose this motion. Thank you."", 4: ""When our family moved to Chile, we gave our grandma an iPad so she can have FaceTime with us while we're living abroad. But my grandma managed to set an unknown password on her iPad, and she locked herself out. So then now we have an iPad in her house that hasn't been open for five years or more because she chose this like unknown password, and that she can't figure out. So basically, my point here is that just saying that we can do stuff online sounds simple, but it's not simple for the elderly, right? Elderly people are simply, no offense, but they're not really used to electronics. It's really hard for them to suddenly have this kind of device that allows them to communicate with people online. There's a lot of difficulties that face them from making a simple account or even getting the internet, especially in rural areas where elderly live in secluded areas away from the city. They don't even bother to have an internet or a Wi-Fi router, right? So I think it's very infeasible when they say that, oh, we can just do this online, right? But more importantly, we say that even if they do get this kind of communication via screen, it's still not enough, right? Like, of course, I enjoy debating online, but I rather prefer doing it in person. The same goes for taking care of people, right? We think that the elderly don't just need to see their child's faces, right? \n\nThere are lots of other needs that they have that can only be fulfilled by them living together. So basically, we see that the elderly are, first of all, very lonely, because maybe their spouses died decades ago, or maybe they're living in really rural areas that have a decreasing population. They just need someone to constantly be by their side. \n\nBut more importantly, a lot of elderly have diseases, like both physically and mentally, that prevent them from living healthily on their own. This can be like Alzheimer's, right? If you have Alzheimer's, there's always a danger that you can wander away from your house, not be able to come back, or you can't remember what you wanted to buy for your groceries, or these kinds of things are like daily disturbances in order for you to live a comfortable life. But more importantly, if you become physically weak in the process, it's really hard for you to even go to the supermarket, especially if you have to drive, for example, because you're in rural areas, or like it's really hard to walk around the house as well. Because maybe if you have stairs, or maybe if you have like a really long hallway, it's really hard for you without the support of someone beside you. So firstly, we see that these kind of physical and mental issues are significantly serious, and that can never be solved on opposition side where they only have the internet.\n\nBut secondly, why can't it be like helpers, right? Opposition so far has been talking about things like financial aid or getting helpers, or just sending them to daycare whatsoever. But we still think this is very bad for the elderly. First of all, there is not enough daycare nor helpers, especially in a lot of developed countries like Japan. There's so many populations of the elderly, and so few working-class people that the simple ratio isn't enough to fulfill the demand for these kinds of taking care of the elderly. So I don't think not all elderly would be able to get a helper or be able to get into a quality daycare. \n\nBut more importantly, a lot of elderly don't want to go to daycare in the first place, especially if they have to leave the neighborhood or the community or the house that they've been living for decades and decades. It's really stressful for them to leave stuff behind, right? And more importantly, a lot of elderly, once they do go into daycare, they're going to be spending their whole day watching TV, playing bingo, doing meaningless stuff. And with this poor facility and little entertainment and small community, that overall leads to their stress, which also leads to the shortening of their lives, and a lack of quality of life that we can never support. That is why we still say that this kind of financial support provided to the elderly is still not enough.\n\nThen on the other hand, what we see uniquely from the government side is things like physical health and physical comfort, and direct communication between the child and the parent. This kind of intimacy and this kind of physical proximity is what we can uniquely achieve on government side, and the reason why you should vote for the government.\n\nBut then let's look at what they themselves talk about in their arguments, right? So firstly, this whole issue about children getting a lot of stress because they have to cope with their grandparents or their parents' lives and so on. But we negate the very premise that they wouldn't be able to coexist, right? Let's say like a working mother, and like their high school daughter have really different lifestyles, and have maybe different times to wake up, but they still live together, right? We think that just because you wake up at different times doesn't mean that you're incapable to live together. I think it's very possible for these two members to live happily in the house. \n\nBut even if maybe they might say, oh, if they're together all the time, it might lead to a huge burden, etc. You don't have to always be together, right? The unique thing about side government is that you're always in close distance so that you can check on them when you have to or like when you need to, but that doesn't mean that you're always going to be standing over them and watching their every move, right? You could always have different rooms, for example, or you have like a lot of like in the first floor, there's the first generation, and the second floor, there's the grandparents that can also, there can be lots of flexible lifestyles within that one house, where like people can live both independently, but where people can also reach out when they actually do need help. So overall, we think that like the possibility of this a huge emotional cost or like huge disturbance to their lifestyle is pretty low. Also considering the fact that today we have a lot of things like paid leave, or like companies supporting their workers to leave their job in order to support their parents, I think it's very feasible for the child to live healthily, even when they have to take care of parents.\n\nBut secondly, they talk about how like elderly becomes like overly dependent on the child, and therefore like it becomes like easy for them to give up, etc, right? Two responses. Firstly, like, just because they're dependent doesn't mean that it's something bad, right? We think that it's the elderly deserve to get a bit more attention than they do now, considering the fact that they have a lot of mental and physical needs that they can't cope by their own. So I think it's okay for them to depend on their child for groceries or depend on their child for things like mental communication or like daily chats.\n\nAnd we think that like the will to live and the will to survive and keep fighting wouldn't decrease onside government because you're always together with your family, your son or your daughter or your grandchildren. Being with your family together is your motivation to keep living, right? On the comparative, when we see old people dying off because they're so lonely in offside opposition's world, we think that there's a higher possibility that elderly becomes more motivated to keep living, and they wouldn't give up inside government's world.\n\nSo secondly, our second response is that like, in the end, it's comparatively better than what we see outside opposition, where like a lot of elderly people do not get the resources they need, do not get the mental support, the attention they need, and they ultimately die off, either from like mental, like lack of mental support, or lack of physical support. So overall, what we see onside government is both the elderly and children living together in harmony, supporting each other, and leading happier and sustainable lives for all these reasons."", 5: ""Their characterization of elderly people is, to some extent, too much thought. The reason why I know this is because I have a teacher's license for junior high school and high school, and I visited a real nursery center, and I know the real situation of how elderly people look like. As exactly, they characterize some people with Alzheimer's. Those who have Alzheimer's really need immediate dependence right now, immediately. For those people, I don't think it's appropriate and realistic characterization that those with Alzheimer's or those kind of elderly people are capable of taking care of their grandchildren. It is very unrealistic. Rather, we think those with Alzheimer's or elderly people are often times, sometimes not, sometimes very getting angry or shouting around at midnight and they start walking around at midnight, and they have to find it. That excessive burden is too much. \n\nAnd we think there is no justification suggested by the government side why this kind of excessive care must be necessary except for sending them to the center or helper and why it should be done by children. This kind of justification is still not heard at the last of the debate except for the material benefit of the spiritual or psychological happiness for parents, and I don't think that's not a good enough reason.\n\nTwo crush points I found, first of all, which is better for children, last, which is better for elderly people. Very simple. \n\nMoving on, first of all, which is better for children. So we are saying is that in order to self-actualize for their children fully in terms of the flee from any specialization to choose whatever job they want, whatever partner they want to stay with, whatever hobby they like to do or the place they live, whatever. This kind of situation to live with parent is very narrowing down their entire choice. \n\nAnd they somehow rebuttaled to something. Number one, in terms of the benefit for their children as well, like I say, they can sometimes take care of their son, granddaughter or please kick out this kind of very independent elderly characterization should be kicked out of this debate. Rather, those elderly people are psychologically weak or those really need health care immediately. That's why they are not capable of doing that.\n\nAnd also, in order to take care of those grandchildren, still we think relying on third-party systems such as babysitter, nursery center is much superior in comparison because they have child care knowledge based on theory, for example, the appropriate amount of food, education or emergency medicine, etc. On the other hand, those elderly people don't follow that theory. That's why we think at least when it comes to taking the criteria of child-caring, still a third-party system is superior rather than relying on these elderly people.\n\nAnd also, that I confirmed at the rebuttal, is that sense of regret is happening. That's why in order to prevent that, they have to stay with parents. I don't think so. Because first of all, even right now, I sometimes visit their grandparents' house, a parent's house, on a quarterly basis in a year. And for example, I'm going to visit them in Golden Week and sometimes Obon and before the end of the year. And that's, I think, very good enough to see them, how they are doing. And that is very good enough. \n\nAnd also, sense of regret is anyway happening on both sides of the house. Because sense of regret is coming from the fact that people have already passed away, right? Just because you guys are staying together does not necessarily mean the sense of regret to death is suddenly disappearing. I don't think, in terms of the amount of the sense of regret, there is not much difference confirmed still.\n\nOn the other hand, let me flip the entire argument of the sense of the emotional points. We are saying, Mika-san greatly explained, rather in terms of the sense of psychology, that staying together is worse off. Why is that? Because, like I said, as an introduction, taking care of those parents is a very much burden, right? So they are sometimes shouting around at midnight. They sometimes walk around the street at midnight, they have to find it. It's too much. That's why sometimes it's called カイゴ疲れ, right? You know that. Sometimes it's called depression, sometimes it's called even suicide, or there are terrible consequences happening. That's why, in terms of the benefit of the sense of regret, it's much uncertain and rather we think the psychological cost is going to take too much. That's why don't rely on the affirmative argument. \n\nThat's why, in terms of self-actualization for children, this point clearly stands. They can choose whatever job, they can stay with a partner, family relationship, whatever the form they like. They don't have to change the place to live; they don't need to go to the suburb area suddenly. That's why, in terms of self-actualization, I also took the debate.\n\nLooking at two criteria. First of all, their safety. Second of all, their psychological aspect. \n\nFirst of all, safety. So, we have already suggested the superiority to this debate, right? In terms of safety, in terms of medication or scientific approach, relying on the center or helper is much superior to those children, because they have enough knowledge or they have enough, you know, they are already professioned based on the nutritious food, based on the what amount of exercise is appropriate to give, and human interaction and so forth. \n\nThey suggested that, first of all, there is no center available. Okay, by relying on the norm, children better to stay with parent. Because of relying on this norm, unfortunately center is in shortage. Rather, we live on our side that children should stay away from parents by relieving our pardon. Rather, we can have the consensus to send the money to the child care center and the elderly care center and the helper. That's why, in order to the amount of the center, this problem is already solved. \n\nAnd also, emotion, right? So, I understand to some extent, granted, right? But still, like I say, the kaigotsukare issue, because of depression, suicide, because of that, sometimes they even neglect to take care of them. Sometimes they start bullying their parents. In order to prevent, rather we think, an appropriate amount of separation is necessary for those reasons, rather than all."", 6: ""Now, adult children are limited, and they are just before overwhelmed. So we need to give them more freedom and for also parents becoming more independent. So we are happy to oppose.\n\nFirst of all, their government side. It is no necessity for all because first about the communication, like why only they need to communicate with, why the family is the most important. Because this just increases the possibility to not communicate with others because the parents only just depend on the adult children and the people around them. So if we make them more independent and communicate with more other people, this is more good for their communication. So it is no necessity.\n\nAnd about the grandchildren, if the adult children take care of their parents, like those adult children can't even have time to care for their children. \n\nAnd also about third, about the emotional support. Like, is it necessary to live together? Because like, they were saying that it's like they can't use this electronic thing and so on. But however, like they can still use their cell phones. But we can't talk to them and we can't know their conditions and so on. So and also, as my other speaker said, like they may neglect those things, bullying and those things, it is really emotional support. So to prevent the situation, it is no necessity.\n\nAnd about their health problems. They were really talking about like they can't go to the helper and those things. But however, as our second speaker said, like we can change the norm. So if we change the social norm, like those government will try to support more helpers and those things. So we can also solve these communication problems, too.\n\nHowever, our point, we have high necessity because first, the adult children have no freedom. And they were saying that like they can, they're living together. So like they can do timetables and so on. But however, they first of all, they live together. So the adult children have to make up time. It is certain. So but time is very important for everyone. Right. So it is it's not good to intervene in their time. \n\nAnd also, again, about the emotional cost. If it's the if their parents have a serious disease, they will definitely become tired to support. So it is more good to use a professional helper because they know really about it. So it's not tired. So it is very necessary.\n\nAnd they were like talking. They were saying that it is peace. But support is not peace. Right. Because if they are like happy. They don't. Those suicides together don't happen and they don't like those depressions don't happen. But because their target is like people. Their parents can't even go to the supermarket, even move. And it means that they are in heavy condition. Right. So we have to give big support to them. So it's so easy for those things.\n\nAnd adult children will certainly worry a lot and always think about parents so they can't concentrate on their working and so on. And that's why it's better to rely on helpers. At least mental burden will become less. So people need time. So everyone, every people have rights to live more freely. So we are happy to oppose. Thank you."", 7: ""Start with the elderly. Many of the elderly in the status quo die from loneliness; they're unable to go to supermarkets because the supermarkets are like 50 miles away in extreme rural areas. So many of the elderly suffer from this kind of emotional and physical burden of being away from their family, being away from people they're comfortable with. We think that this sort of physical and emotional support is something that can only come from living in close proximity with their family, and we see that that sort of support is what the elderly need the most. So we think that this debate mainly came down to the question of which has more benefits for the elderly and the children. \n\nSo two clash points first, which is better for the elderly, and second, which is better for the children.\n\nFirst, on the elderly, we think that opposition overall gave us not much of an explanation of how their side is comparatively better than our side in terms of giving a better life for the elderly. They told us a couple of alternatives about how we can also provide these benefits under their side. Mainly, they told us two things. \n\nFirst, they told us that financial aid is enough, but as we told you from the very first speaker, financial aid isn't what the elderly need. We say that what the elderly need is physical help like going to the supermarket to get groceries that they need or being able to walk around the house, being able to talk to someone about their health issues and so on. \n\nSecond, they told us about hiring helpers and so on, right, but we told you, we told you that like daycare and like those helpers are lacking, especially within an aging population, like in Japan. But we also said that there are unique benefits that come from the children and the family of the family members of the elderly helping them because they're more comfortable in that situation. They're more comfortable talking about their health issues, and also, they're able to physically help within their own household, like help them around the house, help them get down the stairs, and so on.\n\nThird of all, they talked about how an online environment is possible and so on, but we've told you that these elderly are not very good at using these technologies in the first place. \n\nBut second of all, we say that seeing your children's face once a year isn't enough for these elderly. \n\nSo what have we told you under government? We've told you that first of all, they need physical help right, they can't drive to the supermarket because it's so far away, or they have health issues that keep them from getting around properly around the house, and so on, and we think that this sort of physical help is uniquely achieved under our side because you're able to live under the same roof, which means that you can help them around the house or help them get the necessities that they need, and so on. \n\nBut second of all, we also told you about how there's emotional help right, you're able to live in a comfortable environment with people that you care about, the people that care about you, and you're more likely to talk about your health issues and so on, and we think that that's a unique benefit that comes under our side that cannot be achieved under opposition.\n\nThe second of all, let's talk about the children opposition told us that there's going to be sort of extreme dependency, but first of all, we don't see why that's necessarily bad right because the children were also taken care of by their parents when they were younger. And we think that we don't see why they shouldn't be doing that once they become older right. So we think that because these children were dependent on their parents when they were older, we think that these children are justified, and these parents are justified in depending on their children in later life.\n\nBut second of all, all the cases that they talked about, like, even though the web speaker brought up most of them, which is pretty late but we think that those are mostly extreme cases right. \n\nSo together we've told you that three things that are like three benefits of the children. First, they'll be able to take care of their grandchildren.\n\nAnd second, that the sort of, they will have this sort of regret, and they told us that that's not going to happen. But we didn't see why because we think that this regret comes from being unable to save them or help them when they needed it the most, if they live far away. And we think that that regret will be better under our side. \n\nAnd we've also told you the relationship between the generations also become better under our side, no response on that point. \n\nSo we think that overall, the elderly will be saved by this close proximity to their children, and we think that the children can also have a better bond with their parents, very proud to propose.""}"
9,【tiger parenting】mixidea高校定期練習,THW ban tiger parenting.,"{0: ""However, we see things like extreme procrastination and becoming a drug addict, for instance, is something we wouldn't accept as normal parents wouldn't either.\n\nAnd next, I'm going to talk about what is time parenting. The first is ignorance, fear, guilt of the child. Parents often times try to relive their life, their child, because parents failed their life, their effort of life. For example, if they fail in the university exams, they want to do their, they force their children to pass the exam, and they want them to live a part of parents' life instead of them. But this deprives child the chance to find the passion and self-actualize.\n\nAnd the second is deprives opportunities of child. The parents often cry from school, and the parents often go, often forced to go to their children from school and piano class, and like that. So if they, if the parents force their children to do that, they don't have, they don't, children don't have enough time to play and don't have a hobby and don't go out with friends. That is necessary for child's health and a dreading identity. Playing with their children causes children's heart more, heart more kind, and to play with their friends, to learn many, many about important things, more than a study and other, other skill, like point. No, thank you. So to lose their, to lose these times is, is harm their child.\n\nAnd the third is preaches academic success of child, and parents often think, parents often think academics and other skills, like piano and sports, is most important, is most important than, than anything else. If they, if they force their children, that is, that is wrong, and that is not for you. Parents, parents, parents may have violence to their children, and parents mind, and parents mind be, be harmed, harmed by their, children's mind harmed by their parents. Point.\n\nAnd, and the, and, and more parents often their children become first place, and they teach their child, other friend, your friends is in a mind, in a mind for you, and, and they teach their children, don't, don't, don't, don't. Point. Don't, do not become friends, then, and, friend, and, then parents force their children do only study or do only piano. So, children can't their, can't anything what they want to do, so, if we, if we take this motion we can't protect their children's rights for these reasons. But, we won't by reparenting. Thank you for listening."", 1: ""So, I would like to oppose to the governments I have said. First of all, I would like to oppose about the parents who force the children is not good.And next, I would like to oppose about the children opportunity to play with other friends. \n\nFirst of all, about parents force the children is not good. So, this is not true because children have less ability to choose something. So, parents have more ability to choose something. So, they have more, they already study many things and know about society. So, parents have more, can choose more right way.\n\nAnd next, I would like to oppose about the children opportunity to play with friends. So, if the children go to swimming school or something like that, art school or something like that. If they go there, they can make friends, right? And children can talk with friends while they are changing clothes or drawing pictures or something like that.\n\nSo, I would like to move on to our arguments. So, I would like to explain three things. First of all, I would like to explain about the choice for the future. And next, I would like to explain what will happen if we ban this motion. And next, then I will explain about the necessity to ban tiger parenting.\n\nSo, first of all, about the choice for the future. We think this is very good for children. Because music schools or cram schools or art schools can draw children's capability or potential. For example, your children and your parents let you to go to many schools and swimming school or art dance or something like that. And you have talent to do something. If the parents let you to go to the schools, children can know what they are good at. And they can draw their potential. And if they get older, they can become some dancer or artist or something like that. So, this is good for children. Point. No, thank you.\n\nAnd I would like to explain what will happen if we ban. So, if we ban this motion, maybe their children can have freedom. But this affects bad effect. Because if we take this motion, parents will support the children. If we take this motion, if the children say no to something, parents can say to that. Because parents will be afraid of that. The action might be abusing. And if the parents will be afraid of that action, the children might be abusing. They can school children or can let something to do. And also, we can define that. What is a tiger parent? Clearly, right? This circumstance will produce that parents support children.\n\nAnd I would like to explain about the necessity to ban tiger parents. So, parents can… Point. Yes. Taken. \n\n<POI>Do you think tiger parents will let their kids be dancers or singers? Or would they just force them to study for the rest of their lives? \n\nAnd the next speaker will say about that. If we don't take this motion, parents can choose how to raise their children. So, some parents will do tiger parents. And other will allow to do anything about it. So, even if we don't take this motion, parents have to raise their children. They also have rights to how to raise their children. If the parents want children to grow up like some ideal something, they can raise like that. And also, if the parents want children to spoil, it's fine. The choice for the future for the children. And it will bring good to children.\n\nFinally,... I forgot to say about what will happen if we ban. Thank you."", 2: ""Opposition decided to take a strategic approach when they decided it was okay for them to neglect the bulk of the argument the Prime Minister brought to you. We say on our side, if we prove that the material we provided were relevant enough, as well as proof that they haven't sufficiently refuted our points, we say we should take this debate.\n\nI'm going to give some rebuttals before I reconstruct the Prime Minister's material. The first thing to note, just on account of their model, is that they haven't been able to distinguish between what a tiger parenting and parenting is. On our side, we explicitly told you the importance of elephant impairing, where we prioritized the freedom of the child, and I explained the importance later, but the problem of Opposition is that they simply gave a one-liner about parents having the ability to choose something because they know society and they already study it.\n\nThere's two problems. First, is that given that it's true, I don't understand how that kind of analysis of tiger parenting is different from normal parenting. I want the DLO to come up here and explain the exclusive benefits that tiger parenting brings. \n\nSecondly, is that we kind of deny that premise, because I don't think tiger parents are more knowledgeable than other parents. We think that if a child wants to be an actor, a tiger parent won't know anything about it because their only interest is about academics, finding a good job, and finding a good future. We think in these cases, you're oppressing your child's future for the sake of academics, and we don't think this is something just.\n\nI'm going to get a few things in my speech in. First, I'm going to prove to you why this is just. Secondly, I'm going to move on to my positive matter.\n\nLet's look at whether this is just. We think that, as Prime Minister touched upon, we think that the government can intervene given there's a very foreseeable tangible harm. That's why the government is justified in implementing policies like mandatory education, because without education, society will collapse, and we also ban things like child neglect and child abuse because of the sake of the practical harms that are imposed to children. We think that on our side, I'm going to prove to you why there are tangible harms, because we think that in our world, the children are rather capable of making independent decisions. The problem of tiger parenting is that they lock that skill up where they force the children to become dolls and become slaves to the dreams that parents were unable to do.\n\nThat's why it was important for LO to refute the material the PM brought to you, which was that they ignore the free will of the child and they deprive opportunities of child. We think that the importance of the child wanting to play the piano or having friends, it may not necessarily be the practical outcomes of playing the piano, but what's important is the fact and the action that these children have the independence and have the capability of thinking for themselves and deciding that they want to do it.\n\nWhy is this so important? Because we think that we should prioritize the children's freedom over parental rights in these cases. Why? Because we think when we look at cases like where we condemned parents who are against LGBTQ children, we think rather now, we're fine and we're accepting of children who are able to make rational decisions by themselves. The problem of tiger parenting is that they don't grant any kind of free will or independence where we force parents to have authority to look after their children as their dolls. We don't think that's the kind of future children want either.\n\nWe think that based on that, we think it is just for the government to intervene in terms of practical matter. We say it is just because we think that it hinders the development of the children's growth as well as any kind of independence, but I'll talk about that in my positive matter. Therefore, the conclusion of the first half of my speech is that we think it is just because there are practical harms where we have to prioritize the children's freedom. We think the LO failed in engaging with this material and we think the opposition already failed on this point.\n\nLet me move on to my positive matter. My second substantive matter is going to probably directly engage with what DLO's substantive, which is the opposition's ideas about the importance of getting good jobs, for instance. The thesis of this argument is that children will be unable to gain good jobs and even if they do, this is going to result in negative outcomes. The premise of my argument is that the skills you possess at universities are built upon your early ages when you live with your mother as a 12-year-old.\n\nWhy is this? Because we say that in cases of universities or getting good jobs, these things are a natural extension of primary and secondary schools. So given this, what skills are needed to succeed in good universities and good jobs? We think this looks like things like the sense of independence as you're now going to be separated from the arms of your parents, right? We also think this looks like critical thinking, to be able to adapt to new changes and think rationally for ourselves. We think these are the skills you need and I'm going to prove to you why these skills are not going to be obtained. Before that, sure.\n\n<POI> Why do you think that children who grew up in a tiger parenting household are not going to be independent when they go to university, where they have to be independent by themselves when they enter universities?\n\nSo it's like saying you're suddenly going to make a child suddenly go on a bicycle without any training wheels, right? We think that we need these kinds of training wheels for these children to think independently, but we don't think it's good when there's going to be a parent just pushing their child until they're able to ride a bike. We don't think that suddenly throwing them out is enough for them to prepare for the universities that, in your best-case scenario, they're going to get into.\n\nBut I'm going to prove to you more specifically, right? Because we think under tiger parenting, these skills are lost because these children were a soulless robot obediently just walking the path that parents led them to. We think that when the path disappears, in the case of universities, because they're probably going to be physically separated from parents, these children aren't unable to know how to walk the path, they're unable to know what to do.\n\nWe think this results in people failing to progress in universities as they don't possess the abilities or the qualifications to succeed. Therefore, this is going to result in the 18 years of your youth sacrifice, your hobbies, your funds, all kinds of sacrifice for any kind for nothing, right? We think this is a terrible investment considering the breach of the children's rights that opposition is suggesting. But even further, let's take your best-case scenario where they do gain good jobs, right? They're able to get in good corporate structures, executive positions.\n\nWe think in this case, what's going to happen is that these people are going to push the knowledge they gain onto their subordinates. So what you're going to happen or have bosses with like diehard spirits, not letting people do what they think, because they're just going to be possessed by the kind of knowledge they gained when they were young, that you should just like, you should let me have authority."", 3: ""Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. Two issues from the Deputy Prime Minister. Firstly, the Tiger Parliament expands the children's choice. A parent is an actor to let the children able to live in the society. Secondly, we talk about the disproportionate risk that children are sitting exposed to for child education. A parent is difficult to teach the necessary things for the children.\n\nBefore that, several rebuttals to the Deputy Prime Minister. Lastly, they talk about how the children's freedom is deprived by the Tiger Parliament. But, ladies and gentlemen, we think the freedom of the children is not so important in the past. The reason is very simple. The children are not responsible in the society. If the children are committed a crime, the parents also take responsibility for the victim. For example, if the children are robbed of something in the shop, the parents have to compensate for the disturbance. That's the reason why the children are living under the protection of the parents. As long as the children are not independent of the parents, the freedom of the children is not so prioritized by the parenting.\n\nSecondly, we talk about how the children are incapable of making decisions. And this policy is against the children. But, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the children cannot judge what is necessary for their living. Because they cannot have the experience of independence in society, also the children cannot earn money in the past. That's the reason why. As long as the children cannot be independent of the parents, the children cannot judge what is necessary for the children. That's why instead of the children, the parents have to educate the children. And this is so necessary. That's the reason why the children's decision is not important in the state. Okay. Taken.\n\n<POI>How are Tiger parents comparatively better than other parents at making these decisions? \n\nOur boundary is not so that the Tiger parents are always good for their parents. The problem of the government bench is, if they ban the Tiger parents, it also makes this a chilling effect for the necessary parents. Because this line of the Tiger parents and the parents is very vague. If they ban the Tiger parents, also the Tiger parents are treated as child abuse. This problem makes sense. So, parents cannot take the necessary education for the children. That's why the burden of the government bench, while the situation is also justified. That's why our burden is not staying. So, Tiger parents are always good for their parents.\n\nSo, moving on to my first argumentation. Tiger parenting sometimes expands the children's choice. The reason is very simple. Parents cannot know what is necessary for the society if they live longer than the children. For example, the parents already experienced many success and failure in their life. Sometimes the parents are used to the raising, and they fail to enter the university. That time, parents think they want to prevent the children from failing by the Tiger parents. That's why we show, at least we show, this is necessary for the Tiger parents. If the kids are without the Tiger parents, sometimes the children continue to be raised. And the children also deprioritize their freedom. They also play with their friends. They just play on the piano. After that, the children regret the same as their parents, right? That's the reason why the Tiger parents are sometimes important. Because humanity is basically raised. Humanity is not always so stoic for themselves. That's why, as the guardian of the parents, guardian of the children, the parents sometimes are necessary for doing the Tiger parents.\n\nSecondly, the important point is the analysis. This policy leads to a chilling effect for the child's education. The reason is very simple. The government doesn't explain what is the role of the Tiger parents in the necessary education. We think, also, we already banned many stoic education as child abuse. For example, the parents cannot love the children 24 hours in the home. Because it's one of the child's education. However, in so many extreme cases, it's already banned. However, after taking this proposal, some stoic education is also treated as a Tiger parenting. This is so unbeneficial for the parents. Because even if the parents love the children, however, if the parents are punished by the Tiger parenting, the parents cannot live with the children. Because the child abuse, one of the punishments of child abuse, parents have to live apart from the children. That's the reason why, in order to avoid this situation, they cannot teach stoically for the children. That is the sole problem of this policy.\n\nSecondly, the parents cannot teach the necessary things for the children. The reason is very simple. Because the parents also cannot know this line of the Tiger parenting. Also, many of the third parties always supervise this parental action. If the children say, I always go to the discipline school, and they say, I don't like this studying, the parents force me to do studying. If some people hear this situation, they also sometimes have the opportunity to stand for the child protection center. Also, the child protection center can punish the parents in the first place. Even if the parents and the children love each other, this third party can't intervene easily. That is a very unbeneficial thing for both of the families in the first place. That's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, we think this policy is not so beneficial in terms of the feasibility point and in terms of the line of this Tiger parenting.\n\nSo that's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, as long as the government didn't explain this line of the Tiger parenting, the necessary parenting, we cannot ban the Tiger parenting. Ladies and gentlemen, we think that if this policy is not just a policy, that Tiger parenting does more harm than good. We think this policy is why the banning is the only way to reduce the child's education for the collective. You think we already saw that this is a necessary point of the Tiger parenting and the damage of the banning of the Tiger parenting, our point is already clear to the government. That's why we oppose the motion."", 4: ""Judge, don't let side opposition run away with their easy burden, saying that they don't really have to prove that tiger parents are good. No, right? If we look at the motion, we're specifically trying to ban a certain thing, and if they can't prove that there's no, like, if they say that, if there's no reason to keep tiger parenting, then you should obviously vote for Gov, because the government is the one that is getting rid of that unnecessary thing, right? \n\nSo opposition do have a burden to prove that tiger parenting uniquely brings some specific benefits to the child, which they haven't so far. We need opposition to clarify what they're trying to support, and why the side they're supporting is comparatively better than the normal parenting that we support, very proud to propose today. \n\nA couple of refutations to the previous speaker, before I get into clash. So firstly, they say that, um, so they say that, like, our burden is not to say that tiger parentings are good, etc, etc, but, like, in the end, if they don't even talk about the benefits of tiger parenting, then they don't have anything to protect on their side, right? So ultimately, in order for opposition to, like, potentially win the debate, they do have to explain to a certain extent why tiger parents are something necessary for the child's education, and why it's something that they need to protect. \n\nAnd the only thing they told us so far is that, oh, tiger parenting, like, because they failed themselves, like, they can, like, teach their child to, like, not, like, regret stuff, and, like, they can teach their child to be stoic and so on. But we don't see why parents have to, like, physically and both mentally, like, abuse their child to the extent that their, like, self-esteem is diminished, they're constantly being called worthless, they're constantly being told to believe that their classmates are enemies, they're constantly told to be top in class, and to always be studying 24 7. We don't see why this method is necessary for the child to be stoic.\n\nI think, like, a simple encouragement, or, like, telling children about the importance of studying is enough for children to be motivated to work for their own passion. Because if children do have the independence that side opposition forgets, then children themselves are able to work hard for their own dreams, for their own future. That is why we never see why this specific forcing and brainwashing from tiger parenting is necessary for the child to be stoic. So overall, we don't see any benefit coming from side opposition so far. We need a response from WIP.\n\nSecondly, they talked about how the line between, like, normal parenting and, like, tiger parenting is really vague. Therefore, we shouldn't take the plan. But no, right? Like, firstly, from the very Prime Minister, we told you three specific reasons of why tiger parenting are uniquely bad, right? Firstly, we told you that tiger parents ignore the free will of the child. So even if the child wants to be an actor, or wants to be a sports player, or wants to be any kind of dream job that they want to be, the tiger parent doesn't even let the child speak out. Because their goal is to make their child succeed and live a life that they couldn't live themselves. That is why they only prioritize academic success of their child, they neglect any kind of free will or opinion of their own child. We think that this is very harmful for the independence over the self-actualization and the overall long term happiness of the child. \n\nSecondly, we secondly told you that tiger parents deprived the opportunity of the child, right? This is like making sure that the child never has a chance to go out with friends, that they never have a chance to make their own hobbies and whatnot. All they have to do in their childhood is go to cram school, do piano, etc, etc. All those like cool, like, you know, those classes that they're forced to go. So we think that they don't have time to play, they don't have time to make relationships. We think that this is very crucial for the child's health, their mental health, and also for building your identity, right? Because your identity is built from your relationship with others. \n\nBut tiger parents not only deprive the kids to go out with friends in the first place, they tell them that those friends out there in the classroom are their enemies, someone that they have to beat and test, someone that they have to beat in order to climb up the social ladder. This kind of wrong morality, skewed vision of the tiger parents is what deprives a child of having a happy social life. \n\nBut more importantly, we told you that because tiger parents are so narrow-minded, and so desperate for their child's success, they ultimately use like harmful and very abusive words saying like, oh, you're worthless, or like, why can't you do this, etc, in order for the child to succeed. And we think that this puts like the wrong set of morals, as I told you before, and overall ignores the long term success of the child, because they think that, oh, as long as you can get into like a top university, like Harvard or Kodai, like everything is going to work out. That's their like narrow-minded, like a plan for their child. And we think that this is never good for the child.\n\nOur second speaker told you that specifically what children need is independence and critical thinking. If they constantly follow the parents' plans about like, which cram school to go, which universities to go, what like subjects to study, then they will never gain this kind of like self-independence, like self-thinking skills, right? We think that this is especially harmful, because children are never going to be with their parents forever, they have to step out into society at some point. And even if they do get into like a very good university, or like a very good job, once they leave their parents' supervision, they wouldn't know what to do, right? \n\nSo ultimately, even if we take side opposition's best case, is saying that the child does leave us with like a successful life in terms of with brand and career, they will never last. So even if they get into like a top university, what we would ultimately see is them falling apart, they wouldn't know what to do. Overall, we think that this is this would be this will not be a long term success of the child is something that we can never support.\n\nFinally, this whole issue about whether tiger parenting or relying on the knowledge of other parents is discussed. Some argue that kids lack the knowledge to make decisions. We disagree; kids have access to schools, teachers, and the internet, providing ample resources to learn about their dream jobs. Additionally, we haven't seen evidence supporting the idea that tiger parenting is inherently better than other parenting styles. Therefore, in evaluating parents' capabilities, this argument should not be considered.\n\nThe leader of the opposition suggests that in the government's world, kids will be spoiled, and parents won't be able to discipline them. Let's consider the average parent. While they may allow their kids to play video games or socialize, they would discipline them if academic performance suffers or if the child becomes addicted to video games. This approach is part of average parenting, and it would still be allowed in the government's world. \n\nHowever, what we don't support is parents ignoring a child's desire to socialize, confining them to their rooms, enforcing late-night studying, and responding to lower test scores with harmful and abusive words that undermine the child's identity and self-esteem.\n\nWe assert that such harmful and abusive parenting practices should not be supported. Our stance is not an endorsement of every child becoming spoiled; rather, we propose the establishment of a third party, as suggested, to examine personal parenting styles and ensure the well-being of the child. This way, children can thrive, be happy, and succeed in the long term, forming the basis of our pride in this proposal."", 5: ""I think that the one flaw coming from the government, and it's that they didn't show any workability within this version. They told us that tiger parenting is somehow a bad thing, but it didn't really show us why after taking this motion, the parents are suddenly going to change and going to stop tiger parenting. When it comes to domestic cases, we think that parents are still going to do tiger parenting to begin with. Within that, it doesn't really change the situation from two reasons.\n\nNumber one, we say that it's domestically happening. Same as domestic violence, because it is happening under your family, it's hard for the government to supervise all of those things. Unlike domestic violence, where your husband, your wife can run out and go to the police, when it comes to children, because they don't really have any knowledge about domestic violence or tiger parenting, they don't even know the fact that they are being tiger parenting and this is somehow illegal.\n\nBut number two, we say that because the harm that is being imposed if children are mild where it's a psychological harm compared to domestic violence or child abuse, which is a physical harm, it's unlikely for other people to find out to begin with. Secondly, we say that because it's a mild abuse, children don't really realize and don't really go to the police or other places and say that they are being tiger parenting. We think that it's unlikely for those parents to stop tiger parenting to begin with.\n\nSecondly, we say that it's arbitrary. We've told you that the line between tiger parenting and normal parenting is completely arbitrary. And there are three criteria why it is uniquely bad? Even if it is uniquely bad, we don't think how they are going to define tiger parenting to begin with. We say that I'm just going to decide the amount of time that their children are going to study. We think that that's completely absurd. No, thank you.\n\nSecondly, we say that we don't think that they have proven the BOP that they have to prove to begin with, because what they need to prove is not that to us, like to a certain extent it's harmful, but they have to prove all, or like 90 percent, it's most of the time harmful to children. We don't think that they have actually proven that BOP to begin with.\n\nThree analyses to look at this debate. No, thank you. Number 1, in a principle way. Number 2, how it's going to be for their social interactive ability and last of all, talking about the academic ability that they are going to gain. First one, to a principle.\n\nSomehow, the Deputy Prime Minister, I think that he didn't really have any strategy within the state to begin with, because the Deputy Prime Minister said that the practical outcome justifies this debate. Let's, if so, let's go with practical outcome. But then he said that the freedom of choice for children in itself is something important no matter the practical outcome. The Deputy Prime Minister proposed an example, LGBTQ plus and you shouldn't hinder the choice that that person has. The precise difference between LGBTQ plus and the difference between tiger parenting is that being LGBTQ plus isn't necessarily harmful. Well, without tiger parenting, without a lady child having any supervision, those children are going to have a bad practical outcome. We think that in terms of a principle argument, what they are just saying is that, consequently, what they are saying is that, let's compare with a practical outcome. So I'm happy to compare this debate within a practical outcome.\n\nSo number 2, how about the children's social interactive ability? So the Prime Minister told us that they need to have time to play with their friends. Number 1, I say that in general, even they are doing tiger parenting, obviously, they can get once a week to play with their friends. But even in the hard case where tiger parenting is imposing an everyday schedule, we say that there's an existence of school, right? When you go to school, they can at least play with your children without any supervision from your parents. You can go out to the play field during lunch break. We think that with school, you can guarantee the social interactive ability for children.\n\nSo let's go to the academic ability, which is one of the most important parts of this debate. So the side of the government gave us one-liner analysis as the children have irrationality. We don't think so from several reasons. \n\nNumber 1, we told you that children most of the time are irrational, right? They don't really see the society. They don't know how society works. And we think that they are unable or incapable to decide what kind of ability they need in order to succeed or in order to do what they want to do in the society.\n\nBut number 2, we say that there's peer pressure from your friends, right? When you look at other youth friends playing in the park, you also want to play and join that part because you don't necessarily think that studying is as much important as playing with your friends, right? So we think that peer pressure would force you to play with other friends as well. \n\nAnd number 3, we say that principly, parents have the right to decide over children's ability in terms of medical treatment and civil court because they are under the supervision of parents, right? \n\nAnd the side government told us from the opposition and from the government that teachers and the internet would help those children. The point here is that they don't even have the idea of asking those things to their teachers or the internet, right? Without any kind of supervision from their parents, we don't think that children know what to ask their teachers to begin with, right? \n\nAnd secondly, we talked about how independence is going to be lost by Tiger parents. We say that children are gradually going to acquire independence to begin with because we don't think that Tiger parents are going to last for high schoolers, right? Children are gradually going to gain independence. And when they go out into high school, although they might be Tiger parenting, at least they can decide what kind of friends that they want to hang out with, what kind of subject that they want to study, what kind of university that they want to study, right? We think that Tiger parents often take place in elementary school or like junior high school to begin with, right? \n\nAnd secondly, we told you here that there weren't any practical outcomes that came from the side government, right? We think that this is something important in this day because they somehow want to compare this today on a practical level. We didn't show any kind of practical outcome that is going to be beneficial for children, right? We explicitly told you the benefit of tiger parenting exists because academic achievement is regarded as the primal success in the society. Children have the necessity to go out to go to a good university and to go to a good high school, right? And we say, we told you that most children are normal, right? They can't really decide anything by themselves. And we say that this analysis is the primary analysis for children with one disability."", 6: ""Okay, three failures from the government's side today. So, firstly, they talked about wrong things in this debate. Secondly, they have failed to refute our point. And thirdly, they made no engagement. So, I'll talk about those three things from one by one.\n\nSo first of all, we like to say that the government has been condemning tiger parents as if they are abusing children. The Whip government claimed that tiger parents say abusing words to children, or the Whip government told you how tiger parents brainwash children. We said that is different. The deputy leader, Opposition, told you how parents who experienced failure don't want their children to do the same thing. So, we told you, after all, tiger parents don't want to actively harm children, right? Because if parents actively harm children and narrow down their opportunities or narrow down their freedom of choice or whatever, that is called abusing, and that's out of this debate. Therefore, their point cannot be the voting issue here.\n\nSo, moving on to the second thing. This is about lazy children. We told you, we have proved that tiger parents are necessary in those cases. The Whip government claimed that we need a specific reason why tiger parents are uniquely good, and we did. \n\nSo, we told you how lazy children are naturally lazy. They keep playing games and they don't have thoughts about their success or they don't have enough free will for their future, so they have no rebuttal for this point. The only rebuttal likely for this point is, oh, if children are playing video games, parents can't stop them from playing video games, and that's not called tiger parenting. This is so illogical here, because firstly, this actually supports our argument, because we told you, some children are lazy, so if the parents don't keep telling children to study or do something else, they wouldn't stop playing games, because that's what lazy means. \n\nSecondly, the other side is principally contradicting. They talk about how children are rational and have opinions as to what they want to do, but at the same time, the Whip government describes TV games as something that parents can stop if their children keep doing, and we don't understand that, because under this stance, parents have to respect children's freedom of will and let them play. But we told you how this is so problematic, and this harm is so tangible, so therefore, as the D Prime Minister said, we have tangible harm if we take this motion, therefore we mustn't take this motion.\n\nSo moving on to the third thing, why lazy children is the main issue in this debate? Because firstly, we told you that's necessary in terms of parental responsibility to children. We told you how parents who have experience than children have to make the choice instead of children, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition told you. \n\nAnd secondly, we say that the government side has been talking about their best case all the time. They narrowed down this debate by telling you that children have free will from the point of their birth. \n\nAnd so thirdly, we engaged to that point because we told you how children have at least some choice who to hang out with or what to watch. So therefore, it is clear that we must not take this motion."", 7: ""Just The Whip literally conceded that their own side has only like one fault, which was a minor case about feasibility. The opposition side only talks about the feasibility, but we don't think that this point is very strong. \n\nAnd secondly, we don't think the practical, like the enormous harm, which is going to outweigh our harm, that we talk about the paragraph parenting in their point, so we think that this point is very weak, that they should never take in this point. \n\nBut moreover, the opposition side of The Whip has a lot of late arguments or justifications. Like they said, we should judge things like in the court, or the individual should have something like, the individual can have some kind of choices in high school, but they never told some kind of logic of this. And moreover, we think that it's too late talking in this debate, so this is late argument, so just please don't take it.\n\nOkay, I'd like to go to our comparison. Okay, well firstly, this debate is very simple. Well, the opposition side never told like how benefit it's going to happen by doing tiger parenting or like that, so we think that because of this, there is not this kind of benefit gained by this tiger parenting. \n\nWe think that the benefit is too small for it, but what the proposition side told you is that there is a lot of kind of harm, which is going to, which they never engage, so we think that this point is very strong, it's going to happen in our paradigm, so we think that comparing these two harms, or like these benefits, we think that our point is ending.\n\nOkay, let's see in the micro cases. Okay, firstly, we'd like to talk about which side can lead children to the better future. Alright, so they always say that they can have a better future by having like good jobs or big like academic skills or like that, but we never, we actually engage on this point by saying that alright, well maybe they can go to this like big corporation, but it's normal that you're going to be fired by bad human relationship or communication with your boss or co-workers and not, cannot be promoted in the society, rather you're going to quit this kind of job. These things are happening in the society. We think that there is this kind of like benefit is very little, and moreover, this is not good for these children, right?\n\nSo how our side can lead better future for it? Well firstly, we're going to say that by banning this kind of like tiger parenting, we're going to say that the individuals can have the choice or like the time that they're going to think about this future. If you're going to have tiger parenting, you don't have any kind of time which you're going to think about the future. For example, if you're in high school, you're going to say, oh please go to, you have to go to Todai. If you're not going to Todai, you're not like a human or like that, or like what these kind of tiger parenting is too pressuring these children, and we think that it is harming a lot. \n\nHowever, if we're going to ban this, we think this freedom is going to be gained to these people, right? So this, we think that the students are going to think about what kind of like university or like jobs they want to have in the future, and we think that it's going to be the better one. How is it so? Because firstly, we say that we can have the aim that we're about studying or like that, right? Then secondly, we say that because the individual is going to have like the passion that they want to do it, we think that it's going to be the better future. And moreover, because certainly we think that individuality is going to be made, so we think it is better than their paradigm, which these children are being dependent on these parents or like that, and they can never think about like others or like that.\n\nOkay. Secondly, we'd like to compare their point by saying that which kind of, which role should be like prioritized. Well, they always say that the parents are very rational or like that, but we're just saying that our side is going to support elephant parenting, right? These parents are going to put the children's individual choices, try to see children to have a better future by giving choices, right? Because we say that the children are going to like have like passion or like other things, we think that we can lead to a better future. That is actually why we're going to propose. Thank you.""}"
10,【ゲスト 大村さん、榎本さん】mixidea高校定期練習【2nd スピーカーの役割レクチャー + ラウンド】,THBT all employers should allow their employees to work from home whenever physically/technically possible.,"{0: ""Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. We think this motion has the tolerance of the employees' rights, employers' rights to maximize the profit of the corporation, and the employees' right to expand their choice. But we, as a government, prioritize the employees' rights, even if the employees have some damage by this motion.\n\nSo three things from the Prime Minister. Firstly, in the status quo, an employee receives harm by the force to come to the corporation in the building. Secondly, in the step-down, the employee can't expand the right-side choice, and the government has to prioritize. And thirdly, the employer's right just to maximize the profit is not prioritized, rather than the employee's right.\n\nBefore moving on, I'll explain regarding the policy. Firstly, we think the employer has to make the effort to guarantee the environment to all of the employees to take the telework. For example, if possible, they have to introduce the internet environment, and if possible, they have to make the new chat room in the corporation. But as long as possible, the employer has the right, has the moral obligation to make the new environment to the telework, so that is the stance from our side of the house.\n\nFirstly, the employee receives harm by the force to come to the workplace. In the status quo, many people who have the difficulty to go out, there is a very similar. For example, some people have to care for their parents, and some people have to raise their children. And some other people, they are very difficult to work, to come to this workplace. For example, they are very disabled, and they are very difficult to work, and so they are very difficult to long-distance transfer. So that's why many people, right now, have very difficulty to come to the work. Why is it? \n\n<POI> So if these employees have to take a look after these parents at home, how can you guarantee that they'll be able to concentrate on their work?\n\nI think also in the special treatment, it's also existing in the status quo. But we think, without admitting all of the employees, also these people have the difficulty. That is also explained by this argumentation. \n\nSo why is this new specialty, sorry, why only some people are admitted, and it's so difficult in these workplaces? Firstly, the other member feels uncomfortable with the special treatment. Sometimes, this colleague thinks they are very subordinate at home, they are very cheating in this workplace. But also, these targeted people are also uncomfortable, because they also know that other people don't have the satisfaction to meet. So that's the reason why, in this special treatment, it's also harm to these people, they have the difficulty to come to these workplaces. That's the reason, I mean, as they're abiding to the protection of all of the employees, this, all of the admission is very important. So that's the reason why we think the norm, the employee come to workplaces is already normalized. So to break up this norm, we think that to admit all of the members is very necessary in the first place.\n\nSecondly, ladies and gentlemen, in the after-plan, they can expand the lifestyle choices. For example, in the after-plan, the reason is very simple, the mother and the father who can't find this kindergarten, and this is a very small number of the kindergarten, basically in the social program. However, in the after-plan, even if they cannot find this kindergarten, also they can, both of the parents can work at home, and at the same time, they can also care about the children. That's the reason why many different and diverse people can equally work at home. Also, sometimes if they live in Shimane, but they want to work in Tokyo, regardless of the birth rate, regardless of the condition, they can get the benefit at the same time in the first place. \n\nThat's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, after taking this policy, what is the sole benefit? Firstly, regardless of people's environment, regardless of their condition, they can fairly work. That's the reason why in the status quo, only the people who are very, very hard person to work with are only unfairly disenfranchised to get the benefit in the first place. That's why to diminish this unfair damage, this policy is very important in this case.\n\nThirdly, why the employee's right is not so important compared to the employee's right. Opposition might say the employer also has the right to make a maximized profit, and without a maximized profit, also it gets harm to this employer. That's why this employer's right is also important. But we think, as long as possible, the employer has to prioritize the employee's right. \n\nThe reason is very simple. Firstly, the employee is very weaker than this employer, so they can't resist against this employer, because if they are against the employer, they have also the possibility to be fired by this employer. That's the reason why, even there are some difficulties, this employee can't resist against this employer. That's why, as a moral duty, this employer has to protect this weaker position in the first place. \n\nSecondly, this employer doesn't get the harm so huge, because the reason is very simple. Also, by this policy, this employer has the chance to hire many diverse people, even in the theater and graduate in Harvard, even in this workplace in Shimane. That's why, ladies and gentlemen, also, if we can expand the admission, this employer also has the possibility to get the benefit. That's the reason why, as long as this employee also has the chance to benefit, this employer's right is not so important in the first place. \n\nThirdly, also, society already admits to protect the weaker position, even if the employer has the harm. For example, in the society, also, this society holds to the cooperation to hire the disabled people. Of course, if we can hire some percentage of the disabled people, this maximizes our profit. Unfortunately, it's not so achievable in the first place. \n\nBut, ladies and gentlemen, this workplace is very important to live. Without this workplace, many people can't live in the first place. That's the reason why, in order to protect all members of the society, this society already admits to the employer's harm in the first place. That's the reason why, in this policy, it's also applicable to protect the minority people so we get the support."", 1: ""I will talk about two issues in my speech. Firstly, I will talk about why forcing all employees to be in office is critically important in certain instances in order to maximize productivity. Secondly, I will talk about why the corporations, in general, have the right to force employees to act in a certain way. But before that, I will give a response to the House.\n\nFirstly, they generally talk about the interests of the employees. Firstly, we are not going to oppose a voluntary implementation of work from home by the employer in the first place. If the employer feels it's necessary or it fits the current trend, the employer will voluntarily do so. And recently, those kinds of corporations are actually increasing, especially in the current outbreak of COVID-19. So we think that candidates of those kinds of job hunting have a certain choice to move to another company if there is a dire necessity to work from home. \n\nBut secondly, in special instances, for example, the mother or father who has to take care of the child all day, or maybe the disabled person, we think in this kind of exceptional case, the states are already enforcing certain welfare for the employees in the first place. For example, the companies have to allow the employees to take care of the elderly, or the company has to hire disabled people. So we think in that kind of instances, the companies probably have a voluntary incentive to allow those disabled employees to work from home if there is a dire necessity. But we think that forcing all employees to work from home is damaging for some instances, which I'll explain later. \n\nSecondly, they talk about, well, this is also beneficial for the employees as well. Once again, we are not going to oppose voluntary allowance of these work from home. So we don't think it's an issue in today's debate.\n\n<POI>Under special treatment, for example, in parental leave, the other employee doesn't regard them as the same employee. Also, this norm is also harmful to these people. Why is it so justifiable? \n\nWell, we don't think this is going to be a huge stigma in the first place. The mandate of child care leave or maternity leave is already spreading in society. And also, the mandate of hiring disabled people, or those kinds of norms, is generally spread in Western democracy. We don't think it's a huge deal in today's debate.\n\nSo on to the first issue, why forcing all employees to be in office is in certain instances critically important. So we have the three-level analysis as to why being in office is critically important for increasing productivity or efficiency or speed. Firstly, we think that transparency so that employers are able to check whether the employees are effectively working is quite important. Because if an individual works from home, for example, they can be distracted because of their children. Maybe they talk to them, or maybe they have to talk to their families, and so forth. They may not be able to be focused on the work all the time and all the day.\n\nAnd also, there are certain communication barriers that are going to increase. Because if, for example, two employees are in the office, they are able to cooperate.\n\nThirdly, we think that in terms of security, being in the office is critically important. Because if individuals are allowed to work from home, maybe their information in the personal computer may be seen by their families or their friends. Or maybe, for example, if people are able to work from home, they can work at a cafe or outside their home. In that kind of instances, there's a certain possibility those kinds of information may be revealed to the member other than the corporation employees. But we think that for these reasons, the productivity or efficiency or speed may decrease.\n\nAnd the government might say, well, this efficiency or productivity is marginal. But we don't think it's marginal. We think in certain instances, this lack of efficiency or a bit of delay of the work is critically damaging for the corporation. Because oftentimes, these corporations have to conduct their working in a limited time. For example, in case of the insurance industry, usually March or December is the renewal period. And during that limited period, these kind of workers have to do a lot of work. They have a lot of tons of negotiations. They have to prepare for a lot of presentation or paper material so that they are able to negotiate. And one delay or one day delay or one hour delay may lead to a decrease of the profit, decrease of the premium from those kind of companies. Or in case of tech companies, for example, that people have to repair the error or bugs in the system. We see, for example, this is a finance system, that the one day or one hour delay of repairing those kind of bugs lead to the massive loss for the company or massive loss of trust from the customers. We think this is going to be damaging for the company in certain instances. \n\nTherefore, that these kind of corporations are more likely to not allow, no thank you, to employees to work from home. And we think that being in the office and doing the work as efficient as possible is extremely necessary. Therefore, we think that corporations have to do so.\n\nSecondly, the corporation right, right? So, generally, corporations have the right to limit the employees' choice. In other words, they require employees to act in a certain way. Because the fact that the corporation are imposing the working, meaning that the corporation are already depriving their work, their time in the first place. Or if necessary, for example, the corporation are able to require getting certain qualification in case of the accountants are actually in accordance with the need for the work. Or in case of the teacher, teacher cannot express political opinion during the school, whatever, so forth, because it's required as a job, right? So, in accordance with the job, that corporation are able to limit the action of the employee in a certain way, right? \n\nAnd we think this applies to this motion as well. Because, as I said, that being in the office and increasing the efficiency is critically important in some way, right? \n\nAnd we think the only exception we have that the corporation are not able to do so is that there is a dire need in the first place. For example, in case of child care leaving, like requirement of having disabled employees. Or maybe that, for example, the corporation have to, corporation, like, there's a certain limit on the working times. We agree to that. \n\nBut we think that as long as corporation are fulfilling those kind of minimum level of the requirement by the government, we think that it's immoral for the government to require even further. Because those kind of efficiency is extremely and critically important for the corporation's sustenance, for the stakeholders as well. Therefore, we beg to oppose."", 2: ""Because employers are at the top of the company, we believe that their salary is high and their social status is stable. Because of this, we believe that, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. Their salaries are low compared to their employers, and their social status is unstable, and they are easily fired by the company when the company faces depression. And we believe that, at this point, the most vulnerable actor in this debate is that employee. And we believe that that's why we have to force all companies to allow their employees to work from home. And that's why we have to take this plan.\n\nSo, first of all, let me rebut the first argument. So, they talked about the productivity will decrease because of the work in the home. So, we have three rebuts here. First rebut is about the employees' benefits. As our first speaker told you, this plan is giving employees more options. And because of this, more employees can work in the company. For example, people who live in Shimane can also work in Tokyo. And not only people in Japan, but also people in a foreign country can also have a large capability of working. The company can also hire these kinds of people if we take this plan. And it will be easier for them to hire these kinds of people. So, first of all, again, there is some benefit for the employers. \n\nAnd the second rebut is about the productivity. So, they said that productivity will decrease. However, in the 21st century, we believe that most of the work is done by facing the PC. So, the desk work is prioritized in the company. So, we believe that these kinds of work can also be done in the home. Although they are in the home. Because they also have enough facility in their home. \n\nAnd the third rebut is that even if it decreases the productivity of the company, we believe that the government has the right to force employers to accept these kinds of damage to some extent. For example, as our first speaker told you about giving example of that company has to hire disabled people to some extent. So, we believe that even if it decreases the productivity, it should be allowed.\n\nSo, let me talk about three things in my speech. \n\n<POI>So, the world you're envisioning is where you're going to have teachers. You're going to have all these employees working at home. How can you guarantee all these security issues are going to be resolved under your house? \n\nSo, we believe that the security issue of this debate, security can also be well done in our paradigm. Because we believe that in taking after this plan, we believe that almost all companies will have the environment for providing these kinds of facilities. And we believe that these kinds of home working will be much more done in our paradigm. We believe that much more technique will be developed in our paradigm. So, we believe that these kinds of security problems can be solved in our paradigm.\n\nSo, let me talk about who should we save in this debate. So, who is the most vulnerable actor in this debate? So, this is the employee. First, the point is that employees are more sensitive. Let me talk about the employers. They are top of the company. Their salary is high and their social status is stable. So, they will not be damaged by some minor change. And they only face difficulty when the company has a huge debt. And these kinds of things are much less possibility. \n\nAnd compared to employers, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. So, their salaries are low and their social status is unstable. Because they are easily fired by the company when they face this depression. So, we believe that at this point, employees are more sensitive. And because of this, they are the most vulnerable actor in this debate. \n\nThe second point is why do we have to protect the most vulnerable actor? Why do the employers have the duty to protect these kinds of things? This is because the employers get benefits from the employees. So, they have the duty to protect all of the employees. And especially have to protect workers, vulnerable workers. For example, like people who have to raise their children. Who have to care of their parents. Who have difficulty in commuting because they are disabled. They have handicaps. And these kinds of people will be most harmed without help. So, we have to save these kinds of people. \n\nAnd for example, like in Japan. As I told you, there is a law that employees should hire some number of disabled employees. And so, we believe that in this reason, we have to protect most vulnerable employees. And that's why we have to take this plan.\n\nAnd let me talk about why forcing all employees is important. So, first of all, this is because it is difficult for employees to say out when there are some exceptions. So, employees have less power than the employers. So, it's difficult for the employees to say that I would like to work in their home because of their childcare. And we believe that in this point, we have to force all of them not to make these kinds of victims. Thank you."", 3: ""I will explain our first argument, the importance of variation in the space of people's lives. I will explain the merit of employees and how to go to the companies. In the first place, if a lot of employees don't go to the company, there is no reason to go to the office. It is a very serious point. As the first speaker told you about communication, if an employee wants to do a meeting, they can't do it smoothly because their house is built out of bad reasons. I will explain later. Also, the employee can't correspond quickly to work at home. I will explain this reason.\n\nFirst of all, I will explain in the case of employees. Why is it important to go to the company? Because they can limit the quality of life of the company. This reason is that employees can separate their time to their life and working time. The company is a very important space to work. \n\nHowever, after taking this motion, bad things will happen. First, some employees will neglect their work for some reason. First reason is that they can't concentrate on their work. For example, if there are a lot of young children at home, they will cry. They want to pray for their parents. It is very serious because the father or the parents can't do their work or can't do the meeting. Also, the case of women is very serious. Of course, women want to take care of their children. However, if working from home is okay, women have to take care of their children. It is impossible to concentrate on their work. \n\nThe first reason is that the company may take a guarantee. For example, a set of nursery or maternity leave. It is important to concentrate on their work. The company can get profit. \n\nThe second reason is that the relaxed time will disappear. The company presses their work out of work. It is very serious because employees will be impressed with the amount of work at home. It is very serious because the family time will disappear. They can't relax in their home. Variations of people's life will disappear. I will explain the second reason.\n\nThe second reason is that the company has to make a profit. Employees can regulate their private time. Go to the company's merit. Employees can see the amount of work. They can prevent overwork. However, after taking this plan, employees can't see the amount of work. Employees will have a lot of tasks. It is very serious for the situation. \n\nThe second reason is that productivity will decrease. As I told you, the concentration will decrease. The quality of life will decrease. It is very serious to spend life. It is very serious for not only the employees but also the company and employers. Employees are confused about their private life. If we take this motion. Therefore, I oppose this motion. Thank you."", 4: ""The most problematic issue surrounding employees is that the employers just seek for profit and only have a narrow point of vision based on their old-fashioned working experience and aren't realizing the true benefits given by the work at home, the telework. That's actually why we're going to say that we should allow all employees to work at home. \n\nFirstly, we'd like to do two things. Firstly, we'd like to do rebuttals. Secondly, we'd like to compare their point and our point.\n\nThey said that there is some kind of discommunication problem. You cannot tell other people that you want to do some kind of work or other things. But firstly, if it's that kind of situation, we think that we should introduce this kind of telework to all people. Because if you are the least person who is only doing telework, it's very hard to tell other people that you want to do something at home. For example, I want to take care of our parents at home. It's very hard to say. Because of this, it is very harmful for the individuals because individuals cannot choose these kinds of things. \n\nBut secondly, even if they can take this kind of work at home, it's very hard to say. Because it's what one person is going to do at home and other people are working at the office. It's very hard for the individuals to say, please help our work. We think that it's very impossible. So we don't think that this kind of thing is good. \n\nBut rather, we think that these kinds of problems can also be solved by the telework. Because even when you're doing telework, we have Discord, Skype, Twitter, or other kinds of things, which we can tell other people, please help my work. We think that we can do these kinds of things, even in telework. Why didn't they contribute? We think that these things are enough. \n\nSecondly, about the maternity leave or other things, we actually told you that these things, even these kinds of maternity leave or welfare, maybe they're spreading a little. But if we're doing these things voluntarily, it is not spreading worldwide or nationwide. Only a few, only a small number of companies are doing this. And it is not being the fundamental solution. That's actually why we're going to say that all employees should be allowed to do telework. Because we want to liberalize all people by forcing it. And the companies will have the incentive to introduce these kinds of things. And it's going to make or develop these kinds of services.\n\nThirdly, about the security check. All right, well, we don't think that this is very relevant to this motion because we're talking about if it's related to technical impossibility or not. But firstly, we're just talking about technically possible or if it's technically possible or not. And we think that because of this, this is not important. \n\nBut secondly, we say that even if you are in your company, these things are still leaking. We think that there is no difference between these kind of two. But surely, we say that if you're going to have telework and all employees are going to do it, other kind of security companies or other companies will have the incentive for you to make a new kind of security application. And we think that these kind of security can be solved by in this situation, such as these kind of working places. We think that it's going to be equal in these kind of things. We don't think it's a necessary point.\n\nAnd fourthly, they say that some people neglect their work because they cannot concentrate on their work. Well, firstly, this is a very stigmatized case, right? We say that even if you are at home, you can have some kind of concentration. \n\nAnd secondly, even if you cannot concentrate on their work, we think that these people will be fired. But if you are at home and you're going to do telework, you do your best in order to maximize your profit and not to be fired like that. And we think that because of this, the housewives or other disabled people can work at home and do their best too. \n\nFifthly, they say that they cannot relax at home or QOL will decrease. Why would this happen? We say that we're going to restrain long-time work or other things. If you're going to have more various lifestyles and if you can't have private and also work, even in telework, you can't have your private time. Because if you cut Skype or other kinds of working things, you can have your own private time. No, thank you. We think that is very important. And moreover, we think that QOL will increase because you're going to have more various lifestyles. This is why we're going to be liberalized from these small workplaces to old-fashioned workplaces or other things.\n\nWe're going to compare our points and their points. Firstly, we'd like to compare whether working at home physically and psychologically is possible or not can be the criteria of not allowing work at home of employees. Always, they say that the most important thing is to protect the productivity of the company or other things. But firstly, this is old-fashioned thinking. We don't see the truth. If we're going to introduce, we think that this can be done. But firstly, we don't think that this kind of productivity can be prioritized than the individual's working style or other things. Because we say that because of this old-fashioned thinking, the individuals cannot have the right to choose this kind of work at home. \n\nAnd because of this, the disabled people, the housewives with babies or other people cannot work. And these people, the human resources are being corrupted in these cases. If we can introduce these people, we think that we can have more productivity. We can produce more things. And this can enrich these things. \n\nBut secondly, we think that even if it's going to have some kind of harm to this productivity, we think that the vulnerable people in society should be protected. Because the government or other people have the moral duty to do this, the moral obligation. \n\nSecondly, we'd like to say that we can benefit more on the employees and more in competitive markets. We say that in the future, we have to introduce this kind of work. And because we're going to introduce these things, we think that these companies can enrich their market too. That's actually what we're going to say. We should take this motion. Thank you."", 5: ""I think the world they envision is a world that is divided by digital lines. I think it is a world of social isolation, where employees face external job issues, but also internal home issues at the same time. \n\nI would argue that the biggest strategic mistake of the government was that they were going to force these employees to work at home. The funny thing is, they claimed that employees were vulnerable, but it seemed to me that at the moment in which they introduced this forcible plan, I think it's pretty clear to say they're going to be exploiting them more.\n\nI'm going to be looking at this debate in two metrics. First, I'm going to be looking at employee benefits, and secondly, I'm going to be talking about company benefits, given the context of both speeches.\n\nLet's first look at employee benefits. I'm going to be talking about two things here. Let's look at the argument of a birth lottery, and you could just work anywhere. They came up here and just stuck to this example of you can hire graduates of Harvard working at a company in Shikimane. First, I don't know how realistic that example is. \n\nI think that's a pretty minor case, but let's say that's a very prominent issue and that we need to actually look at this. I think the issue is that there was no process. I will stress that the biggest issue is that there's probably going to be no central institution because everyone's going to be working at home. What this means is that there's going to be things like online interviews, online meetings, and the issue is this, is that there's no transparency, right? Just because you're a graduate from Harvard doesn't mean they're necessarily capable or that they're capable of doing everything without any kind of mystique. \n\nI think that there are issues like miscommunication when you work at home, that I think these kind of miscommunication and just an increase of procrastination are a lot of things that are very viable. I think that the comparison we need to make is that when you're together and you're able to talk together and you're able to monitor each other to see if they're doing the correct thing, we think that's going to be much better. Therefore, we think that the issue about having graduates from Harvard isn't something so necessary\n\nBut I will argue that even if it was so important, I think it's possible on our side because if a multinational company, I think it's possible to have a lot of companies in different places. So the talk about Tokyo and Shimane is also achievable on our side. I think the talk about different companies around the world is also an issue that is very resolvable on our side. Therefore, I think this talk about birth lottery is something that's rather much better on our side.\n\nSecondly, let's talk about the quality of life. The context they gave was that, hey, have to look after children or hey, that these children have to look after their elderly because they're weak. Given that this is a debate about all employers forcing all employees to work at home, I think they also needed to defend the cases where they didn't have anything. They didn't have any kind of children. They didn't have any parents living with them. I still, given this context, I don't think there's any just reason to forcibly make people stay at home and work there where there could be a lot of security issues, a lot of miscommunication and force these people to stay at home. \n\nBut let's say, and let's look at these contexts of having children and grandpa. There's two issues. First is that they say that you could concentrate at home, but I don't think you could really concentrate with a crying baby in the background. I think you're going to be rather focused. I don't think that having your own internal issues at home, but also job issues is necessarily a good thing.\n\nBut we agree that this argument, this rebuttal isn't enough to resolve this certain issue of, well, having these elderly or having children. And I think that the biggest thing that I want to stress and the thing that government whip never addressed was that these problems like women's issue, like unequal pay, no maternity leave is not a problem of employers not allowing their employees to work from home. I think it is an issue of employers not taking any active and sustainable measures to ensure a sustainable environment. Therefore, I think that what we could do on our side is to make sure that there's going to be maternity leave, make sure there's going to be a sustainable environment, make sure that people don't have to suffer when they go from home and make sure that they have enough opportunities to look after their parents or children. \n\nThe government whip only refuted this by saying that, hey, this is only happening a little in the current status quo. Then, hey, if that's the issue, then we will mandate it, right? We don't think that it's necessary to just make it voluntary on our side. We're happy to reinforce these kinds of articles and laws. Therefore, I think in the general quality of life, our side is going to be much better because you don't blur the line between work and life.\n\nAnyway, miscommunication happens in the workplace. Why does this extend to become a reason to oppose emotional? I'll talk about that in my next point about companies, and I'm going to involve that in the story about security. There's two points to look at company benefits, and I think it's first, security, and second, productivity and profit overall. \n\nFirst, let's look at security. I think this is a very important point because these kinds of miscommunications, these kinds of information processing, and the privacy is literally what is able to maintain a company's life. That is the information of a new product or consumer data is something that is really important, and I think it wasn't simply enough for government whip to say, hey, it wasn't so important.\n\nThey said that, hey, it happens on our side, but I think that the biggest issue is that it's going to happen more on their side because I think the security breaches and hacking is a very urgent issue that has to be ultimately resulted where people are able to simultaneously work together in a working environment and try to combat that issue.\n\nThe problem is, on their side, you're going to have people perhaps sleeping at different times, and if you're going to be living in different time zones, you won't be able to simultaneously deal with these kinds of things or miscommunications, which could potentially lead to different products and different types of chaos. I think that when you're separated, you're not going to be able to face these issues much better unless you're going to be in this cooperative environment. Therefore, upon security, I think it's a big issue, and I think it's something that's going to be worse on their side. \n\nLastly, let's look at productivity very simply. They said that, hey, if people don't concentrate, you can fire them. The issue is twofold. First is that it's going to be hard to see if they're concentrating in the first place. That's why it's going to be extremely hard to regulate this.\n\nBut second, it's not easy for the company to fire people because they're literally the companions of a company. I think if every employee is procrastinating, you can't fire everyone. Therefore, upon productivity, we see it's going to be much worse on their side. \n\nWe think there's going to be security breaches, miscommunication, and a lot of overall breaches of employers' rights. I think that ultimately, all their benefits can be obtained on our side. Therefore, we think we should win this way. I'm very happy."", 6: ""Two Clarifications. Firstly, we are fine that if it is in the interest of the employers, they are voluntarily going to do so. And the current rise of these trends is actually increasing, meaning that there are other companies that are able to allow the employees to work from home. \n\nSecondly, they talked about what employees generally have the right. That's a general idea. We agree that to a certain extent, employees have a right, but employers also have a right to a certain extent. This is a matter of extent; therefore, we have to assess the pragmatic consequences as to why or whether this policy is uniquely beneficial or harmful for each actor.\n\nMoving on to the first issue - the interest of the employees. The problem with their case is that many of their problem depictions were not uniquely relevant to the motion. They expected the problem of the child raising issue or disabled people or the stress due to the working. We think those kinds of things are already measured by countermeasures such as the mandate of childcare leave or the mandate of hiring disabled people. Also, the annual aggregate working hour is quite limited by the law. \n\nWe think those kinds of countermeasures are already seen in the status quo, and they didn't really explain why a blanket allowance is necessary.\n\nThe deal we already told you, and which was unresponded by the government side, is that it can be worse for the employees, this policy, because there's a boundary between working and private life that is going to diminish under their house. We think that if these employees feel pressured by the corporations to work well, as they characterize, probably they're always thinking about working during breakfast, for example, during dinnertime or immediately before sleeping. They may be pressured to start to open the computer and start to work. We think that this is a thing that currently many employees are actually claiming in the status quo.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion here is that the benefit or interest of the employers they describe can be better in certain instances, but it can be worse in other instances. They didn't really explain why holistically overall, the likelihood of the employer being better off is quite high in the first place. \n\nAlso, of course, we already told you that the interest of the employers or the company is quite urgent. They say it's marginal, but we think this marginal one day, one hour delay can be critical.\n\nFurther, we already told you that the communication barrier is going to decrease, people can be distracted by childcare, or people can't do private tasks while working or maybe those kinds of so forth. We think due to that, their work may delay one day, one hour, or maybe weeks. We think those kinds of marginal time differences are critical when it comes to the tech company like fighting against the finance, errors, or bugs in systems, or maybe that if companies have to negotiate with the customers and the business partners in the limited time. \n\nAlso, there's a certain security concern, irrespective of the technology, that the risk of the information being seen by other people is going to increase. This is crucially problematic.\n\nLastly, the overall comparison. What this is, as I already told you, that got failed to explain or depict in the picture why this policy is uniquely necessary, other than any other measures in the first place. We already told you that we agree that this time and efficiency or the speed may be marginal, but this marginal difference is quite critical for the corporation productivity in certain instances. \n\nWe think that this policy is the override invasion or too much invasion of the corporate autonomy and rights. This policy is unjust."", 7: ""So why we have to force all employers to allow their employees to do the work. So first of all, we are not forcing all employers to like employers to work in telework. \n\nSo and why we have to force all employers to allow employees to do telework two reasons here is that the first reason is that it is difficult for an employee to claim when they are not all allowed. So only one employer has less power, and it's difficult for them to say that they want to do telework. Although all other employees are working in a company, they will be feared to be fired by the company, and they cannot say such a thing, and they will have a problem in the care of their parents or care of their children or in the commuting. \n\nAnd the second point is that, first of all, now there are little numbers of companies which allow telework. And we believe that in this point, we have to force all employers to allow their employees to work in their home because without these kinds of things without these kinds of things that which forces all almost all companies will not allow them to work in their home.\n\nWhat was our proposal? What was our proposition goal? Proposition goal was that giving more opportunities for people to work, for example, like people who have to care parents or children. And this impact is big because these kinds of people will be face difficulty in finance if they cannot work. We, the government side of proposition side, are giving these kinds of people the opportunity to do work, even though, although even they have some say how they have some how they have to care their parents or children. And why did and what was the opposition side thinks? The opposition side was about productivity.\n\nSo what was our refutation? First about this communication. So today, there is no need to we do have no there's no need to communicate face by face. For example, like we gave the example of email or line or Twitter. This communication will not will not occur and will will not occur in these kinds of paradigms. \n\nAnd second about the security issue. First of all, we think that these kinds of things are out of the debate because it means that it is technically technically impossible to secure these kinds of security. However, even if it is in this debate, we believe that the security company will have the huge incentive to develop the technique, and they will do it will be realized that they have no security issue until work. \n\nA second about the mutual exclusivity about the employees' benefit; they said that employers' employees' benefit quality of life will decrease because of the telework. However, this is not exclude this is not unique to our this is not unique because they these kinds of employees can only have to choose to work in the company, not in the telework.\n\nSo let me have the comparison. So first comparison is that we should be safe. So the comparison is that we should be safe. So we believe that the most vulnerable actor in this debate was the employee because employers are tough. They are the top top of the company. They have high salary. They will not be damaged by minor change. \n\nOn the other hand, employees, they are weak. So they they can they will face difficulty in finance if they cannot work for these kinds of people. This issue, this plan is vital for themselves. So we believe that we have to save these kinds of vulnerable actors in this debate. \n\nAnd we also believe that it's also the employer's duty to save these kinds of vulnerable workers. And it's too selfish to, like, get only the benefit from the employees, like, hiring only like, which seems to be benefit for themselves. So we believe that it's also the employer's duty to save these kinds of vulnerable actors as long as they get the benefit from the employees. Thank you.""}"
11,【スマホでpolice brutalityを潰そう】mixidea高校定期練習,"THW financially reward people who post videos of police brutality on popular sites (FB, YouTube, TikTok).","{0: ""Although we can still consider that several kinds of active movements taking towards these kind of several kinds of political or social issues in the current situation, we can't deny the fact that still past discrimination still exists in the current situation, which is actually leading to, for example, police brutality, which is the main topic of this motion. For example, like black people being oppressed by police officers in the United States. This is a current situation.\n\nSo as our stance at the government side, we believe that the problem here, in order to solve these kind of problems in the current situation, the vast majority of people, like the vast majority of people, like who just don't under actually exactly understand what's happening in the current situation. These people who just are so ignorant that they don't even know what's going on. The key problem to actually solving these kind of issues is to actually letting these people know about what's happening in the current situation, actually providing them the correct image.\n\nAnd we believe that actually taking this by taking this motion, we can intensive and incentivize people to actually take part in these kind of actions and will therefore actually spread a correct image and actually make more people understand what's happening in the current situation.\n\nBefore I move on to my two points today, today, I would like to start with a definition and model. So today, as the government side, our definition is that we define political brutality. For example, using, we like to use several examples that are happening in the current situation. So in the United States, black people are getting killed or, for example, in even in Japan, Kurdish people are being attacked in Shibuya. And we believe that these kind of situations are what is called police brutality in the current situation. \n\nAnd secondly, my model, our model is that we'll actually give the people who post videos on these kind of popular sites, for example, TikTok or YouTube, for example, I don't know, a thousand yen to five dozen and just like not a sufficient amount, but just like a little amount that you can buy like your dinner or something like that.\n\nSo moving on to my two points, my first point is that increased media people can be exposed to. So actually, so I would like to explain first, how will actually, how will these medias like, or these, the amount of these videos increase in the current situation. So I'd like to compare it with the status quo. So in the status quo, when people are basically walking on the street and encounter these kinds of social issues, what will happen is because like, first of all, like the, either don't have interest, like they don't want to be related to these kinds of issues because it's so sensitive. They will actually try to avoid these kinds of situations and not really interact actively interact with this kind of situation. \n\nBut because after we take this motion, people can actually gain money. They can actually save, save their savings for like one meal, like they'll actually be incentivized to actually, actually take part. All you have to do is just basically take a video of this whole situation uploaded on the internet. It's so easy. It's, there's no reason actually to avoid this. And we believe that actually many kinds of people will actually take action to, in order to just take videos and upload it on the internet.\n\nAnd the uniqueness here is that because these kinds of popular sites are so popular, trill millions and billions of users around the world are using this. Once someone or like several people upload a single video, several people will access to it. Several and thousands of people ask it. And actually what, and actually the videos or the news that these kinds of situations happen will spread tremendously among these people. \n\nAnd actually I would like next, I would like to explain why it's increasing the amount of these kinds of videos important. So I have two announcements here. First A, that the chances that people can actually see or witness these problems will increase. So the current, the problem in the current situation is that even if these kind of police brutality cases are happening, like only a few people upload these videos. So like not many people can actually have the chance to access to these cases in the current situation. But actually, just as I explained, if we take this motion, the chances that people, because there's so many people uploading videos, the chances, definitely the chances that people can actually have one look of these videos will tremendously increase. And therefore the chances that people can actually witness this problem will increase. \n\nAnd secondly, we can actually provide many aspects of this problem, not only from one perspective, like only one person standing from one angle, not those kinds of situations, but actually tens of thousands of people can actually take these videos and actually understand the whole image of the current situation.\n\nAnd the importance here is leading on to my second point. My second point is spreading the correct image. Before I move on, yeah\n\n<POI> Are you going to financially reward every single people that posted video?\n\nThat's what has been said.\n\nSo next, moving on to my second point, spreading the correct image. Okay. So what does the status quo look like here? Like because there's several reasons why we cannot portray this correct image of these kinds of social actions. For example, the news does not have enough screen time to actually focus on one, one problem. Like, because they only have like, I don't know, 30 seconds to portray a picture. Like they have to cut off many other kinds of parts and only show, for example, the parts that the, that the black person was shot by the white person, but by the white, um, by the white police officer. And like, because of this, people don't actually understand what is, what has happened in the background. They don't even know who actually started the fight, who actually, like what kind of, what kind of, um, conflict happened in the past. So people basically cannot understand the background.\n\nAnd secondly, because for example, only one video or only one image like has been posted on the internet. They don't even know what it's actually the whole image, the whole, um, the whole image of the situation. They cannot understand. They cannot perceive what has actually happened.\n\nBut after we take this motion, because we can increase in number, just that I explained previously, what will happen is that people, people in general can actually understand what is happening because not only the scene they're getting shot, but also like, like from the whole start, like who started the fight or like who actually started the punch, who like those kinds of like, like those kinds of cases can actually, people can actually perceive and people can actually understand by looking at those cases.\n\nAnd obviously the most cases of police brutality in the United States, like are usually the police, the white police officers, like starting, start to like, um, starting to like, uh, argue with these kinds of black people. And in most cases, actually the white people are the, are the people who have started this whole cases. And they're the actually, they're the actually ones who are bad. But if we only portray the scene that someone has been, um, someone has been, um, punched by someone, like people can not actually know what's happening and the impact here is that basically what is crucial in solving these kinds"", 1: ""This motion will only lead to, and will only do such a shallow thing, and only solve the very thin and outer layer of the problem that we are actually facing. So our stance is that if we have the money to financially reward those people, it is better to use those money to things like the education for the, for things like the better education for the police, and the additional aptitude test for the police. And this will lead to much better consequences and much deeper solution of the problem that we are actually facing. \n\nSo we have three arguments, and first is that this motion will only, will not solve the core of the problem, and second that the public will just see the superficial facts and not the core of the problem, and third, I will talk about the alternatives that we can take.\n\nOur first argument is that this motion will only solve the superficial and the shallow things. So what is the core of this Chinese brutality problem? The issue is that police are abusing their privilege, their job, and their social position to the public. Because police are the institution that supervises the public, they do not have the absolute and clear organizations that supervise those police, unlike the citizens. And because they don't have this absolute institution that supervises them, the police have this feeling of superiority towards the public.\n\nAnd even if we take this motion, this idea that police are having will not be terminated at all. Yes, the police might have started thinking that they should not do such violent things because they don't want to be criticized by the media or by the government or by the public. However, this is just a superficial change. And this will not alter the fundamental idea that police are having, which is the superiority that they are feeling, and which is the true cause of this whole problem. So if we want to truly solve this problem, if we want to solve this problem from the cause, from the true cause, we have to change police minds. However, this motion will not be achieved by this.\n\nBut with our alternatives, which I will be talking in my third argument, if we take that alternatives, we will be able to achieve this.\n\nAnd moving on to a second argument, that people will, that the public will just see the superficial facts and not the truth, not the cause of the problem. So also the public will start acting with superficial motivation, and also that they will not, and also they will not move on to action actions to prevent or interfere with the police brutality. So in short, what I want to say in this second argument is that this motion will only lead to superficial actions that only damages the society and not solve the actual problem.\n\nMoving on to a third argument, which is the alternatives. If we have the money to financially reward those people, why can't we use those money to do better education of the police? Well, when we see the reality, it is the fact that the quality of police is declining severely. And if we were able to enhance the quality of the education that police are having, we'll be able to improve the police. And the improvement of police will not only lead to the solution of this police brutality, but it will also lead to other better consequences, such as safer and better security of the society. So for this reason, we believe that we should not take this motion. And if we want to solve the problem, we should spend those money to other things such as the education of police. Thank you."", 2: ""So, our goal is to find the police for terrorism. And this is because of their public eyes. And this can be made by giving financial rewards to people. So, I would like to add an argument.\n\nSo, our third argument is if we take this motion, we can protect people who do demonstrations. And we have two reasons. First of all, about informed consent. And if we take this motion, we can do that. And second, people who participate in demonstrations can prepare for demonstrations because they can realize what the police can do or not. Like putting gases or etc. And this makes these people safe.\n\nSo, what is important? So, we have imagined that they have a strong will to participate. Like these people have a strong will to participate and don't care about their lives or their bodies to show their wills. But this is not true because they have rights to be safe because they are all humans and have rights to be safe. So, if we take this motion, we can protect those people. So, the opposition side must protect the police. But our side can protect those people. And this is our majority. \n\nAnd moving on to the rebuttal. So, they said about two arguments and one alternative. So, about the arguments. So, they said that if we take this motion, we have harm for the police. However, in this debate, police who do brutality can find by using SNS and upload it. And our world can change police minds because police have to be like not to discriminate people.\n\nSo, their alternative was to educate police and it's better than pay people. But we were financially, but police are all human and have feel to, maybe someone have feel to discriminate someone like black or Spanish or et cetera.\n\nSo, but our side is better than the opposition side because our side has more public eyes because they wanna upload videos and get rewards. \n\nAnd this movement will also affect the media because media will broadcast those videos, etc., etc. And police don't want to be on the TV as the opposition side also said. So, they will stop doing brutality. So, our side is more better.\n\nSo, I would like to move on to why is better than our side. So, we have, people can get financial reward if they upload video of police brutality. So, it will make the increase the number of video. So, at the opposition side, they also have videos about the police brutality. But our side is have more number of video. So, their side, the number of video is, they have few videos. So, there's an edited video in a worse way on purpose. So, if we take this motion, these videos will increase because many videos will be uploaded. \n\nSo, in the status quo, we have few videos. So, if they have the edited video and can make misunderstanding, it is not reliable. But if these would be uploaded on SNS, it will be the truth on those people. So, for example, a crew person received police questioning from a Japanese police last month or this month, maybe. But the person who took the video edited and just uploaded only the scene that the police hold the crew. But the police just did a questioning and there were no racial discrimination. \n\nSo, after plan, many people will upload some videos or upload many videos. So, some videos are the edited video. But others are the whole scene of the action. So, the number of the police who do brutality will decrease because we have public eyes more than opposition. So, maybe we have to consider about the video violence. \n\nAnd if the children watch, it might have a bad effect on them. But this is not true because it is a social issue. And if we take this motion, we can make the environment that children can think about the post-brutality or discrimination more than opposition side. So, we would like to propose. Thank you.\n"", 3: 'This is not enough situation, producing only violence and only a number of violence and muter. Because there is still discriminately thinking of people and police. Police are still prejudiced against people. So police can\'t arrest people, can\'t arrest every people equally. Like there are prejudices for black people, and these days this prejudice causes many problems for the world.\n\nNow I\'m going to move to the rebuttal. The government says that if we take this motion, we can protect people who participate in the demo. But this is not true. Rebutting isn\'t, can\'t protect people. Because this is only giving money to people, and the government doesn\'t have any radical solution, does not provide any radical situation. So this is not, this can\'t protect people. Because the police are prejudiced, and the people\'s thinking that they can\'t change, don\'t change. \n\nAnd the second, the government says that we can change police\'s mind. But these posts contain emotional posts, and these posts can\'t say the truth, totally true. So these posts can\'t change police\'s mind radically.\n\nNext, I\'m going to move on to our argument. You said that ""People who participate in demonstrations cannot be protected with the status quo. But if people watch the video, they can know what the police do or what the police can do."" But if people know about what police do or something, this does not directly protect them.\n\nNext, I\'m going to move on to the reconstruction and new arguments. If we take this motion, the revolt will become more big. Because there are three reasons. First, big impact more effect government. And second, some people disregard essence and get benefits by using this situation. And third, media is so unstable, and this may cause populism to the world.\n\nFirst, I\'m going to explain the big impact more effect government. The government side, he said that the government rewards all people posted about brutally police on SNS. But there is a question, how does the government manage a large amount of posts? So this is so hard and difficult. But this is exactly. Effective posts will be watched more by the government than small effect posts. And the government doesn\'t always reward. Like regularly demonstration or little accident. So rewarding all posts are difficult and are so hard. And the government doesn\'t have so much money. \n\nAnd there is an alternative to use money for other solutions. Like police, teaching police or something. \n\nSo for these reasons, bigger effect posts take attention of the government. And bigger effect posts definitely get a reward for people. Then people tell the magnificence of the brutality of police by posting. And then this may cause the magnificence of brutality on purpose. And this isn\'t a radical solution of brutality.\n\nAnd the second is my elder told that there will be a reputation of posts and something. So this is a more significant reward. \n\nAnd third their paradigm is so unstable. We can post things and pictures so easily and quickly. And these spread to the world so quickly. And it\'s easy to affect other people. And maybe not true sources spread the world. The problem is more significant. And this is not a radical solution of the accident. So we should oppose this motion.', 4: ""So, we can see the goal of, like, saving the people from brutality and saving the victims like black people and having some movement like hashtag Black Lives Matter. But what the problem we're trying to push is that as we, like, make financially reward people, the government will make chaos because of those kinds of, like, incentivize and as a conclusion, a counterproductive, like, situation will be given, proud to oppose.\n\nFor today's debate, I have two clash points, right? So, one, which methods can effectively achieve the goal, which is saving brutality victims to which can lead to proper discourse, right? So one, which method can effectively achieve, right? As I said in the POI, the reason why I did POI is to know how much money to use, right? But unfortunately, or fortunately, the government side said all of the financial reward people will be rewarded, right? But we see that a simple question here, how many Twitter users are in today's society? Millions and thousands, right? We see that as millions and thousands, what's more like going to cost, like millions and thousands of money is needed on the government side, right? One, this is unrealistic\n\nBut two, even if those kinds of situations are given, we have to use those resources in other solutions, right? For example, having like a high quality of police or teaching police what is the importance of like raciality or those sexuality or like treating those like criminals, right? So we think that our side, like an alternative, will be like emphasized and like furthermore, our solution will, our goal will be like set it and having a solution like effectively, right?\n\nTwo, which can lead to proper discourse, right? So let me like clarify again, what is the government stance, right? The government stance was like the vast majority can't understand like those instances. So we have to like increase the amount of reports, right? \n\nBut we have two responses for here, right? One, in the status quo, as my first and second speaker talk about, those video cost is fulfilled, right? The reason why like hashtag backslips matter or hashtag I can't breathe was like promoted, right? Just because those media were fulfilled, right? Those media like influence like appropriately and that like led to discourse, right? \n\nBut the second response, right? Like they are just like bystander effect, bystanders, right? By taking this motion, as my second speaker was talking about, like those, this motion will like simply make people like bystanders, right? For example, like just watching those instances and not like having an action and just like taking videos, right? \n\nWhat those two responses mean and why it is important, it's because people will just like move by money and not inherently like have a strong belief to attacking like those discriminations and like solving discrimination, right? We see that we also like want to save victims and we also want to like prevent those instances happening in the status quo, but what our side will achieve is that inherently like solving problems, such as my second speaker was talking about, like knowing about the fact and changing the structure of the police."", 5: ""So, in short, the opposition side couldn't provide any effective solution, counter plan, and also they failed to provide any harms of our plan. Therefore, we think that we won't start.\n\nTo summarize this debate, we can say that three ways can help those people who are being, like, being subject to police brutality. \n\nThe first one is education, and the opposition side has been supporting this. Okay, but the government side has said that, like, education will change politics' mind. But we think that, we only point out that the government is in charge of education, right? And we characterize government as something that is biased, or, like, no incentive to educate. And their characterization was, like, government are happy to do education.\n\nBut we think that our characterization won. Why? Because if the government is like what the opposition side characterized, those kind of, like, discrimination or brutal police, those kind of problems won't be happening in the first place. And we say that, in the first place, the whole point of this debate is, like, countering the government, right? So, we think that it is absurd to rely on government when we are countering government. We think this is obvious.\n\nSo, the other two ways are, like, through activism, and the third way is to, like, through helping people who are currently under threat, through, like, some people helping out people who are subject to police brutality, or, like, saving people who are participating in demos. As for activism, like, the opposition side seem to prove that the more better discourse will occur on the other side. Well, we already told you that the government is not a good source.\n\nBut, and the opposition side response was like, on our side of the house, the discussion will be superficial. But we already pointed out that superficial discussion is not something that is bad because that can ultimately help people, and the whole point is to help people, so that, like, whether it's superficial or not doesn't matter. We characterized that what we need to, like, turn people into action is to, like, show people the whole image of things so that people will know the, to know the full extent how police brutality is bad, or, like, how police brutality is, how the problem of police brutality is important. \n\nBecause we told you, like, the number, the whole people, the number is important. If people see more number of those videos, people will regard those police brutality as important, and we think that those are the most necessary thing for activism, and activism will gradually help people. But the most important thing is to help people who are currently under threat, right? \n\nWe think education or other things take time because we already told you, like, it is impossible or, like, takes a vast amount of time or 20 years or 100 years to change people's emotions or biases because, like, the, like, the hate against black or hate against, like, sexual minorities remains for, like, hundreds of years. We think that it is absurd to think that we can solve this problem in just, like, one year or something. And we told you that in order to help people under threat, we think that people need to know what is happening under police brutality, and we think that video is the only way.\n\nFinally, the last point, the opposition I have is money, but we are happy to sacrifice money, even if it takes money, because it is for helping people. We think that their point does not stand, therefore, we won't dissipate.""}"
12,【デュエルしようぜ】mixidea高校定期練習,THW leagalize the duels to the death.,"{0: ""Ladies and gentlemen, imagine when there's a certain criminal that killed your family. Killed all your family and in a bloody situation and you can't do anything in those kinds of circumstances. We believe in those kinds of situations, those individuals are suffering from those kinds of coercive situations and they can't relieve their stress, relieve their desire in the student school. What we have to do is as a government, we have to respect like those kinds of people's choices and those kinds of people's desire to have to win to them. These are reasons why we are proud to propose. \n\nFor today's debate, I have two arguments, one why we can justify for taking this motion to how society can move to respect innocent people's choices.\n\nBefore I move on to my argument, let me have a clear definition and model for today's debate. So like let me have a three-model for today's debate. One, we are fully respecting choices and having a constant between the people who are doing dueling to death, which is having a prescription that is before having dueling to death and several steps are given by doing as a rule. And we are preventing a forceful situation like such as using dueling to death as a bad thing. So what we are going to do is second, having government control, which government can like access those dueling to death quickly. And as I said in the first, like constant and having several prescription, government is having like those kinds of prescriptions and receiving like those kinds of prescriptions. So as like forceful situation will be given, government will like stop like dueling to death. Thirdly, but most importantly, we're making dueling to death as a fight, as an ability, not like using like those kinds of weapons. And that's all.\n\nSo move on to my argument. One, why we can justify this motion by taking into the society. So like firstly, let me like clarify what is happening in the status quo. In the status quo, no regulation to fight and respect choices and like no regulation for respecting people are given, right? So the reason is because this society is now like neglecting from having a duel and neglecting from killing each other, right? But those kinds of virtue given in today's society is now having a horrible situation for individuals. \n\n<POI> What are the situations when people are willing to duel to death, when they know that like in the 50% possibility, they are going to die? Tell me the context of that, of this debate. \n\nOkay, the context is really simple. Like when like those individuals have a certain like desire that wants to kill like such a person, we're going to respect like those kinds of people. And so if they want to kill someone, like maybe like the opponent side won't be like accepted. But when there's a such like situation, when the opponent side like accepts like those kinds of desire, like we will like have dueling to death. \n\nBut I will like explain that more in my constructive speech, right? So as I showed in the status quo, like those kinds of like government is not like having a certain respectful situation for this society, right? But the problem is in the status quo, there's some individual that have a desire that wants to kill people as a reason to hate people, to wanted to kill people, and wanted to like accomplish their like certain suffer in the status quo, right? For example, like when, as I said in the introduction, when family is killed, like in those kinds of situations, individuals are like now having a certain suffer that they want to kill like the criminals, right? So as an extension of like those kinds of choices, we have to respect like those individuals that want to kill like those criminals, or want to kill like those opponent side. \n\nSo what is the reason that these kinds of like criminals or like these kinds of persons who have the high possibility to be killed are going to do these kinds of like dueling to the death? Why is it so? So like we're not saying that like 100% this like dueling to death will be given, but we believe that this motion will like at some like part or at some like point, we can respect and we can like accomplish like those kinds of situations. So for like the conclusion of my like first argument, why we can justify is that we have to respect innocent people that suffer from stress, suffering from like desire that are taken, right? So when like both like choices were now accomplished, and when like those both choices at some like point they like accomplished, we will like take this motion and this is justifiable in today's society. \n\nSo second, like how it will like change this society and respect innocent choices. I have like no time, so I will give it to like my second speaker, but we like strongly believe that this motion will like make like those individuals that couldn't like accomplish this desire in the status quo can like accomplish and we can save those people that can't like pursue like in the status quo. So these are reasons why we're part of it."", 1: ""In dueling, there is always the winner and the loser. It is definitely murder. So even if the loser has already given consent to the risk, that kind of murder is not something that is justified. And we say that choice is not even possible in practical perspective.\n\nSo firstly, I'll get some responses to the Prime Minister. And then the three things. Firstly, what kind of people opt in dwelling? Secondly, why dwelling is not justified? And thirdly, why legal institutions are better?\n\nSo firstly, the idea that the Prime Minister gave you is such a nonsense. So they are practically standing for murder. They said when someone wants to kill someone, we should respect their choices, but we don't see any difference from murder. \n\nAnd moreover, their main example was the revenge by the families of the victim. We have two responses. So firstly, this is completely out of this debate because as for the criminals, we already have justice system that seeks to the fair punishment for those criminals. And those revenge.\n\nAnd so secondly, even if the victim needs to kill the criminal, we don't see any difference from death penalty because if the government wants the criminal to be killed, they can introduce death penalty. And that is better for them because the family of victim won't have to risk their lives to commit their revenge. So their argument falls out of this debate.\n\nAnd now we want to my constructs. So firstly, why dueling to death is unjustifiable? We say because the choice to opt in dueling is such an irrational and forced choice. So in order to protect people from dying because of the irrational choice, we should not take this motion. \n\nSo three reasons why their choices are irrational. So first of all, but before that, we say the kind of people who want to opt in dueling is the people who have troubles that they don't want to solve in courts. But especially, we think mafias are likely to use dueling as their means to solve problems because mafia is a kind of people who can risk their life in their jobs. So and another example is like people who are fighting for their partners. For example, the two men can fight for a woman and those kind of things are so arbitrary and they don't want to settle in courts.\n\nSo having said that, why those choices are irrational? So firstly, as for mafias, the duelers are pursued by their bosses. Why? Because it is likely that the bosses in the gangs don't want to risk their own lives. So they are likely to force their fellow members to get into dueling. And the fellow member has to do dueling because if they reject their job, they will get killed by their boss. So they'll take risk and they engage in dueling.\n\nSo second of all, the circumstances can force people into dueling. In example that the two men are fighting for one woman, the fight heats up and the woman can say things like, show me your power and now get married with one of you that will win the duel. In this case, the both men will have such pressure and will have practically no choice to not get into dueling and still will make irrational choices.\n\nAnd thirdly, there is no informed consent. Think about who will talk about the experience of dueling because the loser will no longer exist in this world anymore. People who are considering dueling will only hear stories from survivors. The survivors might talk about how their problems perfectly solved after experiencing dueling, but they won't talk about, they don't talk about how the victim were suffering or something. So this will lead to possible dealers unseeing their risk.\n\nAnd fourthly, people cannot experience being harmed, being injured or being killed because that's because of obvious reason.\n\nAnd lastly, why irrational choice is so bad? Because the harms cannot be reversed. That in the dueling, people will die and they are no way to return from this. And also they will have a traumatic experience of seeing someone die or huge injury that will make them impossible to walk for their whole life. And there is no going back before the moment of dueling. So we have to protect those citizens. \n\nAnd even if the choice is irrational, the government has a moral obligation to protect its people. For example, there is a seat belt law. When people don't put on seat belt, no one will get in trouble except those person, but the government asks people to put on seat belts to protect themselves. So states have the right to protect its people.\n\nSo second, why legal institutions feel better? So the next speaker will explain about this more in detail, but because of obvious reasons, courts have less harm because in courts, no one will die, obviously. \n\nAnd secondly, this will become a more fundamental solution. Why? Because in dueling, even if we introduce more fair power, people who have more power will live. And this is not something that is justified and the government has to protect especially weak people. Therefore, in order to protect its people, we should not take this motion. Thank you."", 2: ""So let me explain what the differences are between murder and the people who do duels. There are three differences. First of all, the people who do jewels know probably they might be killed, right? Because a murderer kills somebody thinking they won't be killed the next day or something like that. So this is the first difference. The next difference is that both have a clear aim to fight. This is because the first speaker has said that there is mutual consent before they go to do duels. So and then the third difference is they do it for themselves and have a strong will for each other. They have a strong will, and I'll talk about it later too, but they have strong wills to fight others. So they have the will to kill by the fight. And this is the difference. So I would like to move on to the rebuttal.\n\nThe opposition side has said mafias do pressure to the member of the gang or something like that. So people who do jewels might be the member of a gangster or etc. So they might have pressure from mafias. But we have two rebuttals. First of all, they will have preceding to do that, as the first speaker has explained at the definition. \n\nAnd secondly, the government already knows which is the gang, for example, Yamaguchi-gumi or Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi. And the government has to be strict in the research. So I will explain that later too.\n\nNext, about the fight for like two men fighting for a woman. So the government will do the research. What are the aims to do duels? These examples are maybe not a good aim to fight. So maybe the government will research about that. Maybe like you cannot do the duel. \n\nAnd next, we would like to rebut to informed consent. So why this is not true, because they have that risk that the winner says him or herself about he's a bad guy or something like that to fight with. So they have well that like others can say anything about that if he or she loses. \n\nSo I would like to move on to the reconstruction. And they also talk about our second argument and about changing society. So we think that changing, they said if we don't take this motion, we can have less harm. But nowadays, there are many murders. There are many murders to kill someone. But we think that we can reduce the crime by murder because they can reflect their minds by doing duels. This can be a point that can reduce the number of people who don't want to be killed by someone. So this is a benefit for our side.\n\nSo our first argument about our argument was the initial hate. We can respect individual hate and do the drills. So they have rights. And if we don't take this motion, is it difficult to fulfill? Not like difficult to fulfill, right? So if we take this motion, we can reflect their minds that by not being arrested or not illegal, and this is the only choice to reflect their feeling and suffer.\n\nSo next, I would like to talk about it is okay to urge ways to do duels that the government urges ways to do duels. So this is necessary to save the choice that respects the individual. So these drills give people the reflection, right? This means that the government can pursue their freedom. So the government has the responsibility to make options for people to make them happy or make freedom.\n\nSo maybe they might say mutual contents are not good because not good or like they cannot find the people who have pressure from others. But recently, we had lots of information to research everything, even if it's the information of gangs or other secret organizations. By this research, we can prevent fights that people do drills by tops pressure, tops, or mafia's pressure. So for these reasons, we would like to strongly propose the motion. Thank you."", 3: ""I think they've already lost this debate at the point when Deputy Prime Minister told us that killing based on the aim of gangs or killing based on relationship is something unjust. \n\nOn the other hand, when the Prime Minister told us that the desire to kill other people is justified and the government needs to respect that, we don't really understand where the criteria are being drawn to begin with. \n\nBut second of all, we told you that that criteria in itself is obviously going to be arbitrary. They either have to ban everything or they need to allow individuals to duel to death in any circumstances at the point when the Prime Minister told us that the primary principle why we have to allow it is the desire to kill other people and the rational mindset that they have. When the fight between relationships is due to the rational mindset, as they say, we think that they have to agree in the contextualization that we have provided from the side opposition.\n\nSeveral independent responses to a side opposition. First of all, they told us they have this desire to kill other people and the government needs to respect that. I'm going to have a substantial why killing other people in itself is morally wrong. But before several independent responses, number one, we tell you that it's completely an unrealistic characterization where many people have this desire to kill other people. You don't often see those people to begin with because your morality in itself is going to pressurize your desire to kill other people. And obviously, I think in the vast majority of cases, people will even think about killing other people as their desires. \n\nBut second of all, even if you agree to a certain extent that those psychopaths exist under the status quo, those people wouldn't be fulfilled by dueling to death. Because most of the time, those psychopaths' aim is not to kill other people by fighting. Their goal is to batter others, is to abuse others and to torture others with you standing upon the person who you are torturing upon, right? Those cases happen when people sexually assault other people and after that, murder that person. Or those instances come when people use your gun and mass shoot everywhere. That's the desire that those individuals want to have, the desire that you are actually oppressing those individuals and that person cannot even revenge to you. These kinds of emotions are urging them to kill other people and we don't think fighting with other people by fist to fist is going to help their desires to begin with. \n\nBut secondly, they told us that the criminal justice system people, like the victims, want to kill other people, want to kill the perpetrators that killed your family. Several independent responses to that. Number one, we tell you that those murderers are going to be put on justice in the criminal justice system and we don't necessarily think that this is inside the debate to begin with. We think that it's irrelevant. \n\nBut secondly, we tell you, even if that is true to a certain extent, we tell you that obviously that perpetrator is not going to agree to the fight where he has the possibility to be killed. I don't know what they are talking about to begin with. We don't think that the benefit that they are talking about is actually going to be tangible.\n\nSo two things that I'm going to be talking about in my debate. Number one, I'm going to be talking about why the counterfactual on their side is going to be worse off and why the counterfactual is going to be better off on our side of the house. Number two, I'm going to be talking about why killing other people in itself is something morally wrong.\n\nFirst of all, talking about why the counterfactual is going to look like. I think that the leader of opposition did a really great job by providing a certain kind of context that we need to debate in this debate, right? These kinds of contexts are like arguing between a relationship or arguing between gangs or financial troubles that happen under the status quo. \n\nSo let's look at it one by one. First of all, when it comes to the context of the relationship, I think that it wouldn't be solved in any kind of circumstances to begin with, right? Even if you win by killing or harming other people, the fact that you killed someone and the fact that you harmed the other person is going to force you to have a sense of regret, right? Because in general, in society, it's regarded to kill other people as a morally wrong thing. It is regarded morally wrong to harm other people, right? And I don't think that it's going to change even after taking this motion. The vast majority of citizens are going to think like that, right? And that influences your idea as well. So even if you win that case, even if you get that female, we think that it is not going to make them happy. But rather, like whenever you look at your partner that you have won by dueling to death, you have this sense of regret that you actually have killed that person and that you did something morally wrong that you shouldn't even exist under the society, right? \n\nBut secondly, we tell you that when it comes to like financial trouble, we say that the counterfactual is far more likely better than we can provide on our side of the house, right? The court can objectively decide who actually has the responsibility to pay to someone. And we think that this is completely better because it doesn't involve an arbitrary factor, right? \n\nSo when it comes to dueling to death, your strength or like the fortune that you had is going to matter in the vast majority of cases. \n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to courts, courts can decide objectively based on evidence, based on facts, right? We tell you that it's far more better for courts to decide in those instances as well. Even for the relationship case, we tell you that like talking with the other person is definitely going to be better because you will no longer have this sense of regret even if you can win that person. When you win that person, you can win that person and that is going to be, that's going to satisfy you for a long time.\n\nBriefly, why killing another person is regarded as morally wrong thing? Like I think in general, people would agree that killing other people is morally wrong thing even with a consent, right? Even when you see the instance of gang having a dispute with consent, still you regard that as something morally wrong thing, right? \n\nAnd we tell you that the states have to follow the general principle that society has in general, right? That means that when people regard something as a morally wrong thing, when people regard hate speech as a morally wrong thing, obviously you need to ban that. The same thing applies here as well. Even if there's consent, like when people regard like dispute against, dispute between gangs or helping in committing suicide is a morally wrong thing, we tell you that the state needs to follow that. Therefore, we are happy to oppose."", 4: ""First, I'm going to talk about how dueling begins. First, someone has heard it from someone or has a desire to kill someone. For example, if one of the family members is killed by murder, they have a strong desire to kill someone and also have strong hatred for someone. Hatred can't be dealt with in other ways. So, when we face this motion, when we face this situation, we can support this motion. \n\nWhat is the difference between murder and duels? Murderers are not aware that their actions will lead to someone's death, but duelists are aware that their actions will lead to this. Duels are more justified than murder because we are aware that we are going to duel from now on, and this requires the agreement of both parties. By taking this motion, regrets are never formed because we are aware that this action leads to this exact consequence. So, this is justified, and we are going to move on to reconstruction.\n\nThe first and second speakers said to respect their choice. The government legalized in the constitution clearly states that the country respects the nation's freedom rights, but the government doesn't legalize that people don't die by intentional action. For example, in some countries, assisted suicide is accepted by respecting one's decision to choose this. \n\nI know that this example and duels are truly different because assisted suicide does not involve killing others. But the common point between duels and assisted suicide is that both involve a person with strong will. Respecting one's choice is one of the most important things that the government must make everyone aware of. Even if someone was forced by a strong person, whether to die or not is a personal decision, and this decision cannot be made by others. Whether to die or not is a personal decision, so if they decide to duel to the death, we must respect their choice, and this is the government's responsibility. So, for these reasons, we should take this motion."", 5: ""Freedom of choice is not an absolute value. Even now, you're prohibited to use hard drugs or take euthanasia by the law of government, right? Well, I know that there may be some stresses because you cannot take those choices, the individual choices, but we we're prohibiting for these things for several reasons. \n\nOne is that these things, like the personal lives, are the precious and are the are never going going back or recover after you lose it once. If you lose your life once, you dismiss that your life is not going to be go back again, and if these things are going to dumb by like irrational choices, we think that is very harmful. \n\nHowever, the government, even there's some kind of like governmental control, we cannot like, we cannot regulate all the things. For example, if in the euthanasia, for example, in Belgium, a lot of people die by the irrational choices that, oh, I, because like, for example, I was being unemployed or like other reasons, and because of these irrational reasons, people die or lose their life by these irrational reasons. We say that the government should intervene and and should not allow any kind of thing because we cannot judge and we should stop any kind of thing. And the government duty is it predicts the students from the life from the irrational choices.\n\nSo we say and and now and we think that now it is better than them because we say that in in the present situation, people don't have these kinds of choices, so they're not going to be rationalized and try to kill a something like a murderer who is strong enough like Muhammad or like death hunting even you're going to die or like that. We think that these things are just going to sacrifice more people of them in the studies and we think that it's unjust, unjust.\n\nSecondly, we're going to say that the radicalization in the study is going to happen, and so we are going to prohibit from what is. So we we say that if the government is going to legalize this means the government is going to publicly say it is okay to do like these are like dueling to the death\n\nAnd the students will say that, oh, these things, these dueling to the death, is a good thing or in the study. So what's going to happen is the radicalization is going to happen, for example, if you if you have some some kind of like choices these choices are going to have more slippery, so these these things will be extended more people will die.\n\nSecondly, we say that the radicalization is going to happen because people want to see it, for example, in in the in the ancient Rome a lot of people died in the coruscant and kill other peoples in there, because people want to see more exciting things. For example, if you're going to see porn movies, people may say that they think it's not fun and do not want to watch it anymore. Porn movies are made to try to make more funny things. For example, more radical porn movie. This is the same kind of thing we say that if you're going to have these kind of things. We think that the individuals are going to see these things as entertainment and people are going to people are going to see them for fun. We think that it is morally out in the first place. \n\nBut secondly we say that this is going to have more harm for example the exploitation of the poor peoples because they want to get money or like that we think that these things are going to have more radicalization more and more killing more and more death in the studies and we think the government should not allow it.\n\nThird reason is that these kind of like we say that it is legitimate to not allow any kind of thing when the harm overrides the benefit. What is their benefit? They said the benefits that they can do by the duelling to the death is that they can maybe take some kind of like stresses or the desire and they can have some kind of like desires. But firstly this is only a small part of the solvency. We think that this solvency is very low and it's not going to be a fundamental solution. I'd like to talk later. \n\nBut secondly we say that that the inter that our harm is going to have more and then comparing with them because firstly the people's life are going to be lost. Secondly, we say the government cannot have like give more like moral things but they're going to have more harmful moral for the individuals in the side and it for the children we think that is harmful surely we say that that radicalization of the people kills kmore people because we say that people will try to try to do these I do willing to do this and more people will die in society we think that it is unjust.\n\nFourth reason is that um the pressure and um we think that this kind of like exploitation by the pressure is going to happen for example and as we told you there are like unwilling deaths by the these families or like other members in in like Belgium where euthanasia is going to be realized and even though there are some steps steps or content the individual. And invisible pressure corrupts people's life try to strive people to go to death. It's going to kill these people.\n\nWe think that these things are unjustifiable. We say that because these harms are significantly outweighing their the harm and the benefit that they're saying that that they can take those stresses or desire we think that it is unjust.\n\nBut secondly, we like and we like to talk and we like to talk about why their benefits are not going to work well or it's very small. Alright, firstly, um, firstly, um, we think that their model is not going to work because as we told you the governmental control is not an absolute thing. There are going to be some kind of like individual invisible pressure by the studies set by the families or by others. We think that these things are going to happen.\n\nBut secondly, if you're going to have a strong ability like Muhammad Adi or like this kind of person and if you are strong enough, we say that you're not going to have like, um, because you're going to not going to have like weapons in the opponent. You say that, um, I'm not going to be killed in some kind of like these kind of do willing to the death. We think that these people cannot have any kind of relevancy. But surely, it is unjustifiable to kill criminals. \n\nBefore we're going to talk about these kind of like undefiable or not, we say that firstly the criminals, they don't have any kind of like in content or they don't have any kind of incentive to take these kind of willing to the death. We think that there is no benefit for these criminals, right? We say that these things are not going to move well.\n\nBut secondly, we say that, as we told you, the courts should decide these things. For example, we have death penalty. And we think that it is better because you have rehabilitation or like other things. But, and moreover, even after killing or even after you can kill this kind of person, what remains is only an emptiness feeling and more stressive that you cannot put away to others. That is actually why we think that this cannot be the solvency, and our side is better therefore. We are happy to oppose. Thank you."", 6: ""I'm going to conclude this speech by two criteria. Number one, even proclaiming the government case is perfect, why the choice execution in and of itself is invalid? Second of all, in terms of solving the issue, why opposition paradigm can solve much fairly and harmlessly solve the issue?\n\nMoving on to the first point. Okay, so we have already told you there is no rational consent and choice execution is available under dueling. And we have told you two reasons. A, because this is oftentimes forced choice. Like we say, the gang member, for example, trouble in partnership is going to be a massive reason for someone to start participating in dueling. And obviously, there is no rational consideration behind that. If gang members, lower-class persons, are forced or told to participate in dueling for financial reasons or land traveling reasons, there is no optional choice to reject that, right? \n\nPartnership reasons are, of course, the same, that if a girl says, I am going to choose someone who won the game, who wins the game. Obviously, two men have no choice to reject, to actively appeal, you are weaker than the other, right? That's why there is no rationally free choice, which is free from forced choice. There is no such a beautiful environment is guaranteed.\n\nOn this point, the government says, in case only this is a good aim, we are going to legalize it. But there is no clarification of the definition. What's the difference between good reason and bad reason? So we reject that definition in the very first places. That's why in the very first step, there is a massively forced choice. So this is invalid.\n\nAnd the second one is that they don't know the consequences. That's why they cannot make a rational decision. Government say, because they know the consequences and they concede it to the death, it's okay to legalize it. But we reject that premise in the very first place. Ordinary people don't really know how actually they are going to be hospitalized. What does it mean to break the bones? What does it mean to dysfunctionalize their organ in the dueling in the very first place? \n\nThat's why we only allow someone to fight when they are enough trained. For example, if they are professional boxer or MMA fighter who are really trained well, who already know the pain well, and when they get a professional license, at that moment, they are legalized to fight in the Kurosu-Yodogama Stadium, ladies and gentlemen. That's why in comparison to these kind of ordinary people who don't really know anything, we shouldn't legalize it. \n\nThat's why in the very first place, in terms of this kind of the exclusion of the harmful activity, we shouldn't allow the bodily autonomy like my great partner already explained, seatbelt, right? Even someone who is happy to get an accident and get killed by getting an accident in the car, this is not allowed. This kind of the will should be limited by governmental limitation. \n\nEuthanasia context is very different because first of all, euthanasia itself doesn't cause harm to other people. Second of all, in the very first place, euthanasia is not a very applicable example internationally. It is only partly legalized. That's why this is not a universally good example. That's why this is not a valid choice.\n\nMoving on to the solving a problem issue. So I have a few issues here. First of all, this debate is not about whether or not the private punishment by a victim is allowed. This is not the debate, right? So of course, that benefit, all the benefit is not gonna happen when the criminal actually rejects the offer of the dueling in the very first place. That's why the victim does not necessarily have to be satisfied.\n\nAnd the second of all, even if they somehow win, even if they somehow win, still it's not good because there is no root cause identification why the criminals happen and what kind of the rationale behind the criminal. And there is no actual compensation in terms of finance or in terms of the imprisonment of the criminal, ladies and gentlemen. So for all these two reasons, we will be happy to vote."", 7: ""First, I would like to say that our goal is to prevent people from suffering after an event. And I would also like to clarify that we are not trying to encourage duels, just like drinking alcohol is legal when research shows that it is more dangerous than marijuana.\n\nOne of the questions raised in the debate was, how are duels to the death justifiable? The opposition side said that killing is generally seen as morally wrong, like hate speech. However, hate speech hurts a huge group of people without their consent, and the damage that they get lasts for such a long time. However, duels that apply to this emotion are personal, and the only person whose pride will be hurt is the opponent, who is 100% sure that they have enough ability to have a fair fight, and they know that there won't be abuse or torture. If the opponent knew that they would be abused and tortured, they definitely wouldn't give consent.\n\nThere was an argument that there would be people who would very likely be forced to fight. But as we said in our definition, we will conduct investigations so that we can ensure fair fights and that the people who are fighting know that they have enough abilities.\n\nThe opposition side has been acting like the whole country will be harmed, but this motion will only affect the opponent, and it is a personal matter.\n\nIn their second point, they said that because losers won't live, they won't be able to say how hurt they were or leave messages. But not all losers will die, and their point about how messages of their harm won't last does not stand. Thank you.""}"
13,【子なし世帯への重課税!？】mixidea高校定期練習 【もりかんのやさしみ溢れるRFD】,"In a super-aging society, THW impose an additional tax on people without children.","{0: ""We believe that every single person in a nation has the responsibility to contribute to society, to contribute to the country itself, and to take actions that lead to a better future of their country. Therefore, we believe that it is justifiable to take this motion to solve the issues that we are facing right now. So our model is to put a tax on those people who do not have children, and this amount of tax will be constant and equal to everyone. However, we are going to exclude those people who do not have any children due to their economic reasons. Those people who cannot afford another family member and have decided to not create any children, we are not going to put a tax on those people.\n\nI am going to talk about mainly two things. First, why ageing society is bad and why we need to solve this problem. Second, why taking this motion is going to be effective to solve the problem that we are facing.\n\nFirst of all, as we all know, many developed countries are facing ageing society right now, including Japan. For a super ageing country, the future is unmeasurable dull, incredibly fragile, and filled with uncertainty. In the case of Japan, the children in the present days, which I mean by teens and maybe people in the 20s, are an incredibly lower number compared to those people who are in their 50s or 60s or 40s. When those people in their 50s or around those ages reach to 70s and 80s, the people in their teens and 20s right now are going to be forced to take care of them.\n\nThose young, the youngsters in the present days, will be forced to manage the economics and earn money and pay tax to the government in order to secure the pension for those elderly. Because these young people who are going to have the responsibility for taking care of those elderly in the future are small in number compared to the people in their 50s right now, those young have to have the huge burden to support a bigger number of people compared to them. This burden will significantly be severe when comparing to the people in the same position right now.\n\nBecause the government will have to get money, the government will be going to put a heavier tax on those people. They will be going to force a bigger portion of tax. When this happens, those young will be going to lose their incentive to work hard because they know that their money will be taken away largely by the government. They will be able to use those money according to their own will. They will start to work just to get the minimum amount of money that they can live. When this happens, the economy will be deactivated and stigmatized. Obviously, the money that will be spent on the elderly will get smaller. Not only those elderly, but the social welfare that is granted to every single person in the nation, those social welfare will be poor in quality, especially to those people who are in agony of poverty. In their lives, social welfare is playing a big part in their lives.\n\nWhen social welfare becomes smaller or worse, those people will not be able to get support from the government. Those people will suffer even more. Also, those people who suffer in their poverty will increase compared to now. We do not want that nightmare. However, if we do not solve this ageing society problem, we will be forced to face that reality, and we will be forced to regret our past beings that we should have done something to prevent that nightmare that they were forced to face. We do not want that. There is an urgent need to solve this problem.\n\nNext, I will talk about why this is going to be effective. Because no one will be eager to pay tax, incentives to make children will increase. Before explaining this process, I would like to first categorize the people who do not have children into three types.\n\nOne is that those who are very poor and cannot afford children, and second is that those people who despise children and strongly believe that they do not want any children, and third is those people who are in between, who are thinking of having children, but they are not that desperate to have children, so they decided to not make any children.\n\nFor the people in the first category, because the tax will not be targeted to those people, it is totally okay for them because they do not need to pay tax, or they do not even need to create children in order to avoid the tax. For the second people, who strongly believe that they do not want any children, they will be forced to pay tax. However, as I said in the beginning and will be explained in my subsequent speakers, they always have the responsibility to contribute to the future of society, so they, and because they made the choice not to make any children, they have to fulfill their role to the society, and it is okay for them to make, it is okay for the government to make them pay the tax. And for the third category, those people who are in between, because they don't want any tax, but they are also okay with having children, their incentive to create children will increase.\n\nSo those people, which we believe that is the majority of the parents who do not have any children, because those people's incentive to create children will increase, the number of children will obviously increase, and therefore will be able to solve or kind of make the issue better. So for this reason, we propose. Thank you."", 1: ""We also think that super aging society is so serious now for Japan and our goal is to improve aging society and to make social that people have to end willingly. But we oppose this motion because this motion is not a unique way to achieve this goal.\n\nFirst, so now first I'm going to talk about taking this motion isn't equal for every people and second is there is another counter plan and the third argument is this is free for individuals free.\n\nFirst argument is taking this motion isn't equal for people. And now there are a lot of people who can't have children even if they want to have like disabled people and like injured people to get injured people. So those people are if those people want to have children but they can't do that. So to impose an additional tax on these people is not equal and this is not unique for those people. So as the definition we said we won't impose tax for people who have disabled people or who have a disease that can't make children. So that this is this is not our argument but but in this case, there is another counter plan like that to make a system that women can have children more easily and more little anxiety.\n\nSo now why women tend to not have children in these days? So this is because of the lack of money to bring up their child and anxiety for concerning for their job like being dismissed and like that. So now the woman has a lot of concerning for having a child. And so in this case in this society, there are another like that taking more authority maternity leave for women and to make more kind for women to make more kind society and thinking away for women.\n\nAnd so if we if if we take this counter plan there is an effect there is a two effective effective. First, it's easy to have children and the second is the men's men's heart feeling is more like is lighter than now. So first is easy to having children. So if we take if we take this counter plan women can feel more women can feel easier than now for about having a child. So women can give can have children more than now. And the second is which is better for women like first is having children by stressing from government or second is willing to having a child. Of course, the second willing to having a child is more better society for every for women and so women and their partner.\n\nSo if we take this motion people who want people if we take this motion is not unique and is not the only way to solve the aging society. So there's another big counterpart. And this is more this is more this is a little harm than than this motion because if we take this motion people who want to have to win now lose losing losing money lose money and then they can't have to win. So this motion isn't unique to achieve this goal.\n\nAnd the third argument is this is individuals free. So to take to have children or not is it one's free. But there so the details you explain the our second speaker. So for these reasons, I think we should oppose this motion."", 2: ""Not having children costs for society. Having children, it doesn't mean just only having children in a family. They're creating workers, future laborers. And we don't have children, it means they don't create a new generation, who will be future laborers, who will support future society, who will care elders. So we need to take this motion. \n\nMy argument is why not having children doesn't fulfill responsibility, and they will fulfill responsibility by taking this motion. Before that, let me have rebuttals. \n\nSo today's opposition side, the problem given from opposition side was not the big issue, because we will not impose a tax for the poor, or people who can't have kids just because of their environment, for example, they don't have money. \n\nAnd also, they gave the alternative that we believe our plan is better, but because first of all, they didn't explain the process.\n\nSo my argument is why not having children doesn't fulfill responsibility, sorry, sorry not, and they will fulfill the responsibility. So I'm going to have three points. Firstly, I'm going to analyze the children, and secondly, how it does harm for society if they don't have children, and thirdly, how the situation will be solved. \n\nSo firstly, I'm going to analyze the children. They're not just a part of the happiness, but they're future citizens, which means they will make an economical movement, which means they make and keep the country's economic alive and healthy, which is worth for almost all citizens. For example, they can get jobs easily, they can buy things easily, like that, and so it's worth for almost all citizens. And moreover, they are future workers. If they work for online jobs, or like in a factory as scientists, they can develop skills or economics, and they will provide things for our society. So they are contributing for society, each other, like that. And it contains nursing the elders, because they need to, who need to nurse the elders is that those citizens who are not child, but they will be adults. So we need those children. \n\nThe impact of this argument is that, first of all, that those children are very important for our society who we need, or if they don't create those, then they are giving harm to society, which they are not fulfilling their responsibility, which means they should take the responsibility somehow to fulfill the responsibility.\n\nAnd the next point is that how it does harm for society by not having children. So what is the responsibility to create a new generation is that, let's see, for example, in Japan, many people need to quit the job to care for the elders, and the point, otherwise, those older points, nursing, and those oldest. Why? Because in an aging society, those elders are increasing, and they are hard to go into nursing, nursing houses like that. And those children who are those families have to care for the point, all those, so they need to quit the job. \n\nAnd in that case, they can, they are able to use welfare systems, and if the government points, those people will cost for the society by using those welfare points. So the impact of this point is that not having children does very harm for society, which in terms they are causing harm to others, they should take this responsibility, even if they don't have the freedom to escape from the responsibility, it is justifiable.\n\nFinally, the third point, how the situation will be solved. By imposing the tax, those taxes will be used, will be used for welfare services, for example, nursing, the nursing can be high-tech, which helps youngers, like using IT programmings, or like that, and more, they can have more financial support for nursing, which helps the youngers to care, to nurse those elders. \n\nSo in conclusion, what I told you in my speech is that having, having, not having kids, causing harm to our society, which means they need to fulfill the responsibility to contribute to our society, as my first speaker told you, and today's opposition side, those points, are those issues not big enough to reject this motion."", 3: ""So, in the first place, we want to strongly say that PM only said at the definition that they except for the poor but no disabled people and those who have some disease. So, this means that disabled people and patients who have diseases have to pay money even if they have that.\n\nMoving on to the rebuttal and reconstruction. So, first of all, they said that people who think that couples who want to bear children or don't have to bear babies can raise their babies if this motion is taken. But, think about if, in the first place, women who want to have children and have to bear babies with their strong feelings, they must not bear under the forcing. Because if they do that, they would have a burden to raise their babies, right? Because of the additional tax. So, if some of them don't want to pay additional tax and bear babies, they have no strong feeling to raise them. And some of them would abandon babies. And this case will occur.\n\nMoving on to their arguments about future citizens. So, this can be also achieved in the Opposition side, right? Because our side has come to a plan that also achieves raising many babies. So, this can be also achieved on the Opposition side, too. Like children will improve technology also and improve society. And our side thinks that children are important, too. Because we already share the goal that achieves having many babies in the aging society. So, however, our side, we have a counter plan. And this is much better. Because this can happen. No additional tax to pay by one part of the citizen.\n\nMoving on to the arguments of caring elders. So, this also in government's after plan. Elders are existed much as Opposition side. So, people have to take care of them. Also, not only in the government side and also Opposition side. But Opposition side, we can support money to them. And their arguments are all shared with our side. \n\nSo, I would like to talk about our counter plan. And say that our counter plan is better than taking this measure. So, our counter plan was to increase the children. As the first leader of Opposition has just explained. And this can be easy for their children. Because of this environment that women can raise their babies or bear their babies easily. And they have spiritual marriage that they have no forced choice. And have freedom on the government side. \n\nSo, we have planned that by two processes. First of all, it is to urge maternity leave or making a kindergarten. Or something like a facility that children can play there all day. And more, so that women can work comfortably. And secondly, it is to support money if women raise their babies. So, this counter plan doesn't have to pay an additional tax on people without children. Because people who raise their babies can get money. And also, as I said before, that people who are caring elders can get support from the government by giving money. So, we think that this is very effective in the super-aging society.\n\nSo, our third argument was the evangelical right. For example, people who don't want to marry or people who don't want to raise their babies. So, our example is that people who don't want to marry, especially the man. So, taking the motions mean that if the people who don't want to pay tax. They have to get married and bear their babies. And raise their children and pay a lot of money. And children have to get better education. And they have many orders to raise their babies. So, this is very unjustified between these people.\n\nSo, for these reasons, we would like to oppose. Thank you."", 4: ""I would like to actually thank the government side for clarifying why we actually need to increase the number of babies in this current society. But the problem that they lack, what they actually needed to do in this debate is to provide a fundamental reason why exactly taking this motion is the most effective way and the most efficient way to actually achieve this goal in this whole debate. But they totally failed in talking about this. They only talked about the benefits.\n\nAnd on the other hand, we've provided a better model that actually attacks the core problem of why these issues are currently happening, even in the first place. And I would like to further expand on that. \n\nI would like to talk about mainly two issues in my speech. First of all, which side can effectively solve the solution better? And secondly, which side can actually provide a better society for our future citizens?\n\nOkay, so next, first, moving on to my first point, which side can effectively solve the solution better? Like, in the PM speech of the government side, the PM actually gave three characters of the people who cannot, who do not have babies. And we believe that this is actually true. First of all, the people who are extremely poor. Secondly, the people who don't want to have children in the first place. And third, the people who can but they just don't want, for several reasons. We think that this is actually true. But the problem here is that the first two characters here are totally not mutually exclusive. And on the other side, they will still not have babies. So what I'm trying to say here is that the most important actor, the vast majority of the actors in this debate, stakeholders in this debate, is the people who can but just don't want, just don't have babies for several reasons.\n\nI would like to clearly explain why they do not, why do they not exactly have babies in the current situation and why, by taking our counter plan, they will actually actively try to make more babies and actually tackle the whole goal in the first place. So the reason why the people, the reason why these people in the first place do not have babies is because I think there are mainly two reasons. First of all, they only have an average income. They're not extremely poor, but they just only have an average income. And they're really worried that they cannot fully support their children, cannot provide an extreme or enough amount of education to their children, even if they have them. And secondly, the people who are just worried about their own career, their own future themselves. But the government side totally mischaracterized or even failed to even characterize these kinds of people in the first place. So I think we already win this debate by clearly clarifying them.\n\nAnd secondly, why we can actually achieve this, why these people will actually actively have more children in the future is because, first of all, just as our first speaker and second speaker have clearly mentioned, we're going to provide more maternity leave and even actually support these people in the first place. So like even if they only have an average income, because we will support them financially, they'll also be able to have more babies or even try to have more babies because they actually receive those kinds of financial support. And secondly, the people worried about their career, their future, because we'll provide them more maternity leave or other kinds of options, they will definitely try to make more babies by taking this plan.\n\nSecondly, the second issue of today's debate, which will provide a better future for our citizens. So I would like to mainly put a focus on two actors. First of all, the people who are actually their parents in the first place. And secondly, their children. \n\nFirst of all, what will happen to the parents? Just as an explanation, people who have only the average income are worried if they can fully support their children. Because these people are just literally forced to have children just because they just want to get away from these taxes or even maybe forced by the whole social norm in the first place. They're basically forcing their own lives into a very endangered situation where they do not have enough money, they do not have enough support. \n\nBecause their parents are even in a financial crisis, literally. They'll be forced into a low-quality life, not enough education, and those kinds of stuff. And we believe that these people, like the government itself is sort of failing their parents and their children in itself. And we believe that this will keep on going, but people keep on going for generations and generations. This will never stop. It actually worsened this problem in the first place.\n\nSo we believe for all these reasons, we totally take this debate out of the government. Thank you."", 5: ""So there were two questions in this debate, first was about people's choice of kids versus society's benefit, and we think that our plan will provide benefits for millions of people in the future and for the new generations to come. We also explained how not taking this motion will definitely lead to gradual corruption of society, and not taking this motion will be a threat for countless people in the future and we must think about the long-term effect.\n\nThe opposite side was saying that when the number of people increase suddenly, it will be hard for people to do nursing, and we think that is exactly true, however, we explained that our plan will not make people in the future harder to nurse old people because the additional tax will be used on welfare, and so that more people will be willing to work in facilities for the elderly, and they will also be used for schools, such as kindergarten, and so this does the same thing as their counter plan.\n\nAs for the second clash, was about our plans, and they talked about creating a great environment for women, and we had three points about this. \n\nFirst, their counter plan was very vague, and they didn't provide enough process as to how their counter plan will lead to solving super aging society. Second, even if their plan did work, even if we think that our plan would work faster, it would be much more efficient, and we emphasize the efficiency of our plan. Third, by having additional tax, it will be much easier to create a great environment for women, and we think that with the status quo, their plan is not realistic at all because it's hard to get money, and money doesn't just come out of nowhere, and we don't understand how they are going to pursue their goals.\n\nAnd the opposition side was really focused on having people not wanting to have babies, and not wanting to pay tax at the same time, and we think that our plan will provide a great environment for mothers, as we said, using our additional tax, and we think that because parents' environment will be suitable, abandoned babies won't be a problem at all\n\nAnd moreover, if some people, like the opposition side said, if some people have such a strong will to not have babies, if they truly resent children, then they would definitely choose to pay tax to avoid having children, and so their best case about not having tests, and not having babies, and does not stand. \n\nAnd when people start having more babies, there will naturally be more people who will start having children, and with that, it will naturally, the society will try to adjust to that, and their environment will be much better, so our plan is much faster.""}"
14,【小石川高校 vs WSDC連合】高校定期練【高校生のバイトって実際どうなん】,THBT it is better for high school students to do part time job during their school life.,"{0: ""The school days are a really crucial period in our lives. During that period, high schoolers should experience as many things as possible. That's why we are happy to propose.\n\nSo, in the first place, let me define this motion. So we, the government side, follow the current law for part-time workers by which we allow students to work for no more than 10 hours a week. We set these hours because high schoolers should spend a certain amount of time on studying, not only part-time jobs. And also, if they extend these hours to the late night, there might be more dangerous jobs, more dangerous part-time jobs for high schoolers. So we fought to prevent those dangerous jobs. And for the first reason, we set these hours.\n\nSo, first of all, let me tell you what part-time job brings about for high schoolers. So, I'm going to talk about one thing. This is experience of society and working. Let's take an example of doing a part-time job in a family restaurant. There, we can interact with people of various ages. For example, from people of high schoolers and people of 30 years old and people of 60 years old. So, there are a lot of ages in having a restaurant.\n\nAnd by interacting with those people, interacting with those people is not experience that high schoolers can get in high school. This is because in high school, there is almost... High schoolers interact with only people of the same age, right? And even if they interact with people of different age, this is like one year older or one year younger. Students don't that much, that often interact with teachers. By doing part-time job, they can experience of society and working, in which there are a lot of people of various ages from young to old.\n\nSo, how is this? How is experience of society and working good for high schoolers? So, let me divide high schoolers into two groups. First, high schoolers who will go to college after graduation. So, for those people, doing part-time job can broaden their interest and know what they are suitable for and what they are not suitable for before college. This is really good for high schoolers because in college, they will do what they are interested in or what they want to do or something that is good for their future. By experiencing part-time job before college, in which they do what they are interested in, they can know what they should do in college or what is good for them before college. So, they can learn and they can do better things in college. The second group is people who will not go to college.\n\n<POI>How does washing dishes at Saizeriya benefit people who want to be, for instance, scientists or soccer players? \n\nI think people who want to be soccer players don't do part-time job in Saizeriya or come to restaurants like that. Because if they want to be a professional soccer player, they should practice. There is no need for them to do part-time job in Saizeriya.\n\nSo, now let me move back on to my argument. So, I'm going to talk about how is this good for high schoolers who will not go to college. So, for those people, doing experience part-time job is still good too. So, this is because they can experience society in advance. So, for example, if they start part-time job from the first year of their high school life, they can experience society for three years before being exposed to society, before the graduation.\n\nThis is really good for high schoolers who will not go to college because if they are not going to college, after graduation, they will just go to society and start working. So, by experiencing society in advance, they can learn what to do in society or how to interact with people in society. So, that means letting high schoolers doing part-time job during their high school days means that there will be much more time for preparation for society. So, this is also good for students who will not go to college. So, in conclusion, part-time gives high schoolers a lot of benefits for the future. As I mentioned, that's why we, the government, are happy to propose. Thank you."", 1: ""Panels, what you have to recognize in this debate is that part-time jobs that are available for high schoolers are not advanced. It's not like an internship that is available for university students. You don't acquire any knowledge. You don't acquire any particular skill that is going to widen your future choices. And it's just you're going to probably be exploited. You're going to be you're going to have to dish like wash dishes in Siberia. That's the kind of experience that you're going to have. It's not going to be in any way valuable for high school students. Therefore, we think that high school is better if high school students never experience part-time jobs during their school days.\n\nNow, two things to talk about. Firstly, I'm going to talk about why part-time job is uniquely harmful. Secondly, I'm going to talk about, in comparison to other alternatives, why part-time job is particularly worse on comparative. But just before we go on, just what are our stances and clarification? And then I move on to rebuttals to the side government.\n\nNow, what are our stances and clarification? We support academic and club activities of high schoolers. We don't support part-time jobs. And furthermore, we also think that the context of this debate needs to be probably about a developed nation.\n\nGiven that the majority of high school students who are from poor households in developing nations probably cannot afford school in the first place, probably are working full-time jobs, you know, as child labor or whatever. And furthermore, we think that this debate, I think the government would probably concede, should genuinely be about which side can provide better outcomes for high school students in the future, whether or not to experience this sort of part-time job or not to experience this.\n\nAnd the premise of our arguments is going to be that, I think the government is probably going to agree with me, that once you experience part-time job, you're likely to be encouraged to do so later, or you're going to be trapped in the cycle of working as a part-time job. Because the reason being that the fact that you get money, the fact that you get slightly economic independence from your parents is likely to attract many high schoolers and they're likely to prioritize the part-time job over school or over the club activities. We think that's a very likely situation that once you experience this, you're going to continuously work in a part-time job.\n\nNow, what then? So let's move on to the response to the side of government. What we heard from the government side, firstly, we heard that, you know, high school students should interact with people from different ages because in high school, you only interact with people from the same age. Firstly, the existence of teachers and parents are the counterexamples of this. \n\nBut secondly, we told you that like when you are in club activity, you would probably like carefully use, you know, respectful word which is keigo to your senpai or you would behave like in a way that you would behave yourself in front of your kohai and that sort of thing. You can still learn what you do in your communicative skill and social skill, even in the framework of school. \n\nThen we heard that they're going to widen the perspective in the future. No, it's not. They fundamentally mischaracterize what part-time job is going to be.\n\nNow, let's move on to the first point. Why part-time job is uniquely harmful. There are two things to talk about. First is that the part-time job is probably going to be manual labor in the vast majority of cases, like dish, like washing dish in restaurants, in McDonald's, that sort of thing. Because those sorts of jobs do not provide any knowledge, do not provide any actual experience that is going to be valuable in the long run. And they might talk about like internships, for instance, but in the majority of cases, like as for internships, the sphere of choice is extremely narrow because not many corporations offer internships to high school students, even though it's available in the vast majority of cases only and exclusively for university students. \n\nBut secondly, no thank you, is that they're likely to be exploited under the cheap wage because they're just high schoolers, right? They're not from any elite university. They're just high schoolers who are kids, right? So they're likely to work in really, really cheap wage. So we think that it's uniquely harmful.\n\nSecond point, in comparison to alternative, why part-time is bad. Now, there are two kinds of skills that I think matter in consideration of the future choices that children are going to have. One is communicative skill and two is academic skill. We think both are equally important, like when it comes to expanding the future of children as much as possible.\n\nNow, firstly, as for communicative skill, we think that it can be acquired through club activities, for instance, within the framework of school activities like you do, like you do debating, you do basketball, you do baseball, you do soccer, that sort of thing. Firstly, you're going to be able to learn how to interact with others, how to interact with your senior, with your junior. But secondly, like you're able to find what is fun for you, right? The fact that I was able to find my hobby, which is debating, has expanded my future opportunity in a great way, right? Now, I'm able to interact with these great, great people who are online right now, right?\n\nNow, secondly, as for academic skill, we think it's important to note that in developed nations, there's a prevailing norm that going to university is the prerequisite for your success. That is to say, when you apply for a job, you have to graduate from an elite university in order to expand the choice that you have in the first place. If you have a job that you want to apply for, you need to have graduated from an elite university. That's why we think that in high school, it's particularly important for you to go to a summer program in Tetsuryokukai, which is a cram school for students who want to go to the University of Tokyo, instead of wasting your time, like washing dishes in McDonald's.\n\nBut furthermore, the unique benefits that come in high school is that high school is a precious time, right? It's only three years. And in university, we say that there's not much like club activities, for instance. And we think that's why we provided the unique benefits that come with not experiencing and by experiencing other alternatives that are available for students. For all these reasons, we proudly propose."", 2: ""Club activities are completely different from part time jobs in that students should behave in a responsible way. If you do such a rude thing for the customer, you will be fired. At this point, we believe that the part-time job is completely different from club activities, which they can gain. And we believe that high school students should also have the time to do part-time jobs. And that's why we strongly believe this motion.\n\nSo, let me rebut the arguments first. So, the first argument is about the cheap wage. They said that because of the part-time jobs, they are accepting high school students. The wage will be so much cheap and it will be quite uniquely harmful for high school students. However, we don't think so that the wage is cheap for the high school students. As long as they are high school students, we believe that the money got by the part-time job will be enough for themselves to use things.\n\nFor example, they are not going to use money for their living. For example, like to buy a house or to pay the money for the house or to pay money for water, electricity. These kinds of things can be done by their parents, but they can use the money for the things which they like to do. For example, tapioca or soccer tools or something like that. So, we believe that this is not the cheap wage and it will be uniquely harmful for high school students.\n\nAnd the second point is about the students' future. So, they said that communication skill and academic skill are both important. And we completely believe that. We also agree that these both two skills are important. And they said that for the academic skill, they said that they have to graduate from an elite university. And because of this, they believe that they have to go to the Kyokai Ojuku.\n\nHowever, this is completely against the first thing that they also think that club activity is important. We believe that we can use the time spent for club activity. We can spend the time used for club activity for the part-time job. So, we believe that there will be not so much big difference for the time used different from the club activity.\n\n<POI> So, are you implying that putting on fake smiles at McDonald's is much better than interacting and having fun with your friends? \n\nSo, we believe that we do not have to completely diminish the time for club activity. We can decrease the time used for club activity to some extent. And we can use the rest of them for the club activity. And we can use some time for the part-time job. No, thank you.\n\nSo, then let me talk about the club activity. So, they said that interacting with people is the one thing. And interacting with people is the important thing. And it can be also done for the club activity. However, we believe that all the things done in the high school students, students have no responsibility to interact with others. So, they are not forced to talk in a polite way for their seniors.\n\nHowever, in the part-time jobs, they have to act in a polite way. So, they have to act in a polite way. And they can act with a lot of people. For example, from people like high school students to people seniors, for example, 60 years old, something like that. We believe that in this situation, we can much better learn about the communication skills. And the point that they have the responsibility and they can interact with many people.\n\nThen, let me talk about our second argument. Our second argument is that set the fundamental sense for using money. So, what is high school students? So, when you are a high school student, it is easier for them to use their money for what they like. For example, tapioca, games, perfume, for traveling. All these kinds of things are much more easier than when they are in junior high school or elementary school.\n\nThe second point is that they will use a considerable amount of money compared to junior high school or elementary school. For example, they get money 5,000 yen a month or 6,000 yen a month. The amount of money will become bigger and bigger. And we believe that when they are in the high school student period, they use a considerable amount of money.\n\nThe third thing is about why it cannot be done when university students. So, this is because when they are university students, parents cannot control the usage of the money they gain. So, on the other hand, when they are high school students, they are under the control of parents. No, thank you. Parents can control the usage of the money to some extent.\n\nParents can teach the important things, can teach the way how to use money. For example, when they are using all the money they gain from part-time jobs, using for games, only for games, and do not deposit some of them, parents can teach them that depositing money is also important for themselves when they think of the future. So, we believe that parents can teach the usage of the money to some extent, which is completely different from the university students' period.\n\nSo, why is this important? When they are high school students, they use money without thinking. They use money just for themselves and not think about the money, how their parents work, and do not realize the importance of money. However, if they do part-time jobs, they can realize how it is hard for themselves to gain money. We believe that if they realize such important things, they can use their money in a much better way because they will think much more deeply about their money. At this point, we believe that we can set a fundamental sense for using money, and that's why we believe this notion. Thank you."", 3: ""I think asking a 50 year old man what they want to eat for lunch is not meaningful interaction. I also think that washing dirty dishes for 10 hours a week wouldn't widen your perspective or help you recognize your dream job in any way. We think that part-time jobs are a meaningless distraction that prevents you from focusing on stuff like studying or like club activities or any other action that is actually needed for your life, and that is why we are so proud to oppose today's notion.\n\nA couple of reputations to the previous speaker before I move on to my main points. Firstly, they talked about how part-time jobs are better because you get more risk, you get a bigger sense of responsibility. He explained that because there's a risk of getting fired, you learn to be responsible and not to be rude and stuff like that, but we think that this kind of sense of responsibility or respect towards people who are above you can also be gained through clubs. We think that even if you do not get fired for being rude at club, you still have social status that you have to protect as club member, and in order to maintain the social status, you will be careful to be polite to seniors, teachers, and so on. So, you don't necessarily have legal contract with your boss to learn how to be responsible. So we think that the benefits are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThen they also talked about how you can interact with many. The first speaker talked about how you can interact with people from different ages, but as I said in the beginning, we think that the characterization of part-time jobs, that it's mostly manual labor, it doesn't really require this communication skills that you actually need, and all in all we think that like interaction can be further achieved on stuff like club activities with your friends or your seniors or your teachers, etc. etc., but you take him. \n\n<POI>So can all high students can act in a polite way in the club activity with no existing rules and no manners for themselves\n\nIt may be hard for high schoolers to be completely polite. But like first of all, I don't think we have that much of a burden to say that high schoolers have to be 100% within club activities because we also say that not all high schoolers would be 100% polite once they start like doing a part-time job, even if you have that legal contract. I think like that doesn't necessarily mean that all kinds of high schoolers would like suddenly be polite.So all in all what we basically want to see is that this kind of legal contract or your fear of being fired is not enough of a reason to say that like you, that say that part-time jobs are necessary to gain this kind of sense of responsibility. \n\nSecondly, they also talked about how, and I was talking about how you have to interact with like you get to interact with many people but because there's like a lot of, but because there's a lot of like manual labor involved in part-time jobs, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nFinally, they also talked about the sense of responsibility of using money that can be gained through part-time jobs, but we think that firstly they already contradict their main point when they say that students can learn how to take care of money, but at the same time they also say that parents would control it. We think that like this kind of control from their parents like your own like autonomy as like a. As like a spender wouldn't like be able to coexist so it'll either be the student like freely using their money or like the parents getting like a complete hold of their salary. So like either way, I don't get why they would be able to learn this kind of responsibility in the first place. \n\nAnd even then we still don't see the specific reason why they have to gain this kind of sense of responsibility while they're in high school. Especially if they have another four years or like for some people like six years in university. So in the end, we think that this kind of skill is not necessarily something that should be gained within the three years of high school life, but what we really need to gain during our three years of high school life is things like academic skills.\n\nFor communicative skills that my first speaker talked about which brings us back to our main points. Firstly, the role of high school education. A side opposition believes it's to learn like the basis of how to live in society in the future and like in the long-term, right? In order to do that, firstly, you need to gain like a lot of knowledge to either get into university or maybe it's to get into a specific job or whatever reason. Then you also need to gain things like communication skills, teamwork, or leadership skills, or other soft skills that you need to survive in society. You gain that through daily classes at school and after-school activities, clubs, and we think that these kinds of activities are something that you could only gain in the three years of high school education. Specifically, this kind of opportunity should be the highest priority for students.\n\nSecondly, I'll explain to you why this kind of opportunity would not be able to be achieved once students start gaining a part-time job. So ... the government second speaker said that the wage is not that cheap for part-time jobs, like it's enough for them to sustain themselves and have fun. We think that this is the specific reason why a lot of high school students will keep doing their part-time jobs even at the expense of their academic career getting damaged. Because you're able to gain that money to buy things like bubble tea or go to karaoke or whatever.\n\nThis kind of immediate pleasure and immediate financial gain that you can get from part-time jobs is what keeps the students going, and we think that this is very harmful because they don't realize that the long-term benefits that could be gained from studying or going to clubs would not be achieved. But then they prioritize this short-term gain that they can have from part-time jobs, and therefore they keep working. As a result, this is going to be a huge distraction that severely harms their future in the long term. Imagine you have to spend, they said that it could be like 10 hours or so, but we think 10 hours is pretty long for you to spend washing dishes or asking customers what they want for dinner.\n\nWe think that this is like a huge distraction for their lives, especially if they have this financial incentive that keeps them going at all costs. The specific difference between clubs and part-time jobs is that clubs in school are made to coexist with the school work. That is to say, like, you can only practice until a certain time. For instance, if you go to a club, there's probably a limit to the time that you can stay at school. Then, you also have a schedule of the club that is suited to your academic work. Maybe you don't have clubs during the test periods, for example.\n\nSo, we think that clubs are made to coexist within the school system, and therefore, it's really easy to balance your studying and all the other stuff. The unique thing about part-time jobs is that it's just not made to coexist in the first place. Therefore, what ultimately happens is you either get exploited or pressured by your boss to keep working at all costs and keep working for that money. This leads to getting distracted from a lot of the academic activities that you need to gain during your high school years. This would be a huge harm to your long-term prospects. For all these reasons, we're so proud to oppose."", 4: ""First of all, let me set ground for this, for my speech. So there's two analysis. First is what is high schoolers. So let me analyze high schoolers. There's two analysis. First, those go to college. And the second, those not go to college, as the first speaker said. So the important thing of this analysis is majority of students will work after high school. So let me move on to second one.\n\nSo skills they claim, the opposition side claim to be needed. So they argue two points. First, we need communication skills. And secondly, we need academic skills for high schoolers. So they focused on the harm, the harm part-time job have. For example, they, so their first point was harm to academic skills. However, we're very skeptical about the need for academic skills. So as we argued, the majority of students work after, will work after high school, meaning not going to university. So academic skill is not needed for like work, right? So just get into the university. So even though there's a little harm, which club activities will not have that part-time job has to academic skills, it doesn't matter because a lot of, a majority of high schoolers will work after high school. So as we argued, as we argued in the first speaker, primary working, part-time job, primary working experience is good for those students who works after college. \n\nAnd secondly, they argued club activity is enough for what we need. So let me compare club activities and part-time jobs. So there's two axes. First, age. So in club activities, there's just like a two-year difference between senpai and kohai. And also, they go to the, because they go to the same school, they have, they have common background. Meanwhile, part-time, in part-time job, the co-worker, the age and backgrounds of co-workers will vary. So communication skills or like some special experience towards a wider variety of people will be there in the part-time job.\n\nAnd the second axis is responsibility. So they, the opposition side argued club is not the place. So we can, we can have a sense of responsibility throughout the club activities. However, it is not enough because the club is not the place for responsibility. It's, so it's, it's the place for just fun. So even though there's, there's a few club activities which require responsibility, for example, like very strict physical clubs, there is, it really depends on the club's atmosphere. For example, so as we, I said, the club is just for fun. So generally, generally, there's no need to be responsible. \n\nHowever, in part-time jobs, there's legal contracts, as I said, no thanks. There's legal contracts, as I said. So there's, and also there's an exchange of money. There's an exchange of money in exchange for their labor. So, and also as the second speaker said, there's, there's always the risk of getting fired. So incentive, incentive for, to be responsible, it's far more stronger in part-time job.\n\nSo let me conclude my speech. So because the opposition side misunderstood what they needed, meaning they, so they misunderstandingly believe that academic, academic skill is needed. The harm they argued is meaningless. The harm they argued is meaningless. And also because, and also because club activities will not be the counterpart of the part-time jobs, we are happy to propose. Thank you."", 5: ""The problem that opposition bench faces with proposition bench is that they haven't been able to explain first what high school students want. And then we think that there wasn't any kind of clear description and explanation of the mutually exclusiveness of part-time jobs. I'm very happy to propose.\n\nTwo things I'll be talking about. First, I'll be explaining what high school students really want. And secondly, I'll be explaining what part-time jobs bring and why, in the majority of instances, there are going to be more harms than benefits of experiencing part-time jobs as uniquely as a high school student.\n\nSo first, what do high school students want? I'll be using the classification that the prime minister brings, which is first, people who want to go to universities and people who don't want to go to universities. I'll be explaining why, in both of these situations, there's going to be much bigger harms.\n\nSo first, let's look at students who want to go to university. Given that around 90 to 95% of high school students usually want to go to universities, and this is a debate about whether part-time jobs have benefits or harms as a majority. We think this point should be more important than the whip speeches wholly talking about students who don't want to go to universities. We think it's much better on our side if you don't experience part-time jobs for two reasons.\n\nFirst is because you gain more time to prepare and be provided and you have more opportunities provided to see what you want to do in the future than spending and wasting your time on part-time jobs, right? You're able to study, you're able to gain important skills and knowledge, which is essential to choosing universities and careers because you need to actually have information to do so. For instance, we think it's much better if you study biology to be a biologist, or if you study law to be a lawyer, or play sports to be a professional player. And we think these points are much more important, much more feasible and robust than just, than just, I don't know, for instance, smiling at Burger King or McDonald's, right? We think it's much better.\u3000This is especially important when you consider that you are a high school student and you only have a limited time of three years. We think it's most important to know how to use time management. We think it's much better on our side where you actually have more time to absolutely dedicate all your time on things that are actually important.\n\nOn their side, they say that, hey, we could also do club activities and you could just do both club activities and part-time jobs. Notice how this point specifically neglects the variable of high school students because a high school student usually has homework they have to prepare for universities. They also want to have fun with friends, right? The physical burden on mental stress is accelerated when you have to have both clubs and part-time jobs, right? Just one day is enough to save my energy and me having to go to a five-hour shift after that washing dishes for no reason is, I think, rather like meaningless and something that is rather unfeasible. On our side, we do not have these distractions. We also have time to work to polish our resumes for extracurriculars to provide to universities, for instance, which we think part-time jobs rather distracts you. So we say on our side, our side has much more benefits.\n\nBut secondly, we say it's much better for poor people because it's going to be a much better investment of trying to go to universities and actually find a good job and a good career and gaining much better income instead of sacrificing your time during your limited three years of high school trying to do something you don't know if you want to do that in the future. Instead, we think that it's irrational for the government side to come up here and just say that these high school students are always going to know what to do from just doing part-time jobs.\n\nBut let's look at the second case, right, of students who don't want to go to a university. The problem is this, is that they haven't been able to characterize these people, right? People usually who don't want to go to universities and immediately work are people who want to work at their parents' shop or being a fisherman or people with fixed jobs, right? These people already have jobs they want to do, so this negates proposition's own premise that these people would know what to do from doing part-time jobs because they already have jobs they want to do, right? At this point, we think this is meaningless and this is a waste of time because now they have to do things that won't help you at all.\n\nThe government says that academics aren't so important, but we say it is, right? Because if you want to work after your parents' shop, you should rather spend your time being able to focus on what the shop wants looking after all its geographical locations and how it's doing in the economy in the market, for instance, much than just working at a part-time jobs which you're never going to be affiliated without in the future. Therefore, we say it's better for these people to spend time on focusing on the job you're getting rather on their side. That's why for the first point, for what high school students want, our side is able to match the benefits more.\n\nBut secondly, let's characterize what part-time jobs and what part-time jobs brings. The whole bench of our proposition was that the part-time jobs extend high school students' vision of the future. This is problematic for two reasons. First, because it simply cannot because part-time jobs offered to high school students is usually the things like washing dishes at Caesarea, pushing buttons at 7-Eleven, or creating fake smiles at Burger King. Why is this so? Because we say there's a structural system in society which makes high school students have to do manual labor. \n\nThis is for two reasons. First is because as high school students, we don't have the certificate or achievements as other people who are higher of age. There's a lack of credibility for high school students which makes them have to do manual labor instead of in kind of high-tech programming, for instance. That's why it's worse on their side and it's much better on our side because we get to prioritize these friends. We get to prioritize our limited time at high school. We say we're much better in not having to waste time in all these meaningless manual labor, which you probably never have to use in the future.\n\nBut secondly, even if you neglect all our points coming up for now, we say that their side wasn't able to provide any kind of mutually exclusivity for this point. The only thing that came up here was that, hey, we could just do clubs too. I already explained why that doesn't work. The only unique thing that came up here was that apparently, you know how to use your money management. \n\nThe problem is, right after the second speaker came up here and said that if parents are able to control the money of high school students, that doesn't teach money management, right? It simply doesn't make sense. And it's also not related to the point where part-time jobs offer you money but don't teach you how to manage your money properly. If you want to know how to manage money, you should just do that with the allowance your parents provide you.\n\nAt this point, we think that failing in explaining the difference between part-time jobs while we explain it uniquely just in clubs or prioritizing your friends is much better. Because we prioritize the needs of students and talk to you about how part-time jobs bring more harms, I'm happy to oppose."", 6: ""The biggest issue with Proposition's case is that they do not have a clear benefit of what you could specifically gain from the three years of part-time job experience that you gained during high school.\n\nOn the other hand, what we as opposition have consistently been telling you from the beginning is that these kinds of academic and communicative skills that you could gain from your school classes or your club activities are something unique to high school and something that we need to protect. That is why we're so proud to oppose today's motion.\n\nSo let's go over today's debate. The two main clashes are which side has long term benefits that are actually useful for the child's future. All in all, we think that as a premise, we see the high schoolers because they don't have any academic record or a cool master's degree or something. We simply don't have the capability nor credibility to get into a really high skill job. So as a result, the majority of the part-time jobs that they will be experiencing is manual labor. This is like washing dishes or doing like asking what they want to eat for dinner or stuff like that. And we think that as a result, opposition fails to clarify the specific benefits that you can gain from these kinds of part-time jobs.\n\nSo let's take their best case and assume that this kind of legal contract makes you like a more responsible person. Even if that is the case, we still see that the kind of responsibility that you do gain out of it is quite marginal. We think that all you have to do to be responsible in a part-time job is simply to be at that shop at the designated time and do some chores. Right. And then you're like counted as responsible. We think that this kind of responsibility is not really valuable compared to the responsibility that you gain as a member of a sport team or like fulfilling your role as like a reply speaker or like whatever thing you do in clubs. We think that the kind of skills and the kind of responsibility that you ultimately get out of part-time jobs is quite small compared to the benefits that can be achieved on our side.\n\nAnd secondly, the other benefit that they talked about was about this kind of interaction that you can gain between people. Firstly, we say that their model already contradicts with their stance because it seems that high schoolers only get to work for like 10 hours a week. But still, we also see that like the kind of like manual labor prevents them from like any kind of like constructive communication with like peers or like people older than you in the first place. So compared to that, again, the communication that you can gain within the school is more sufficient and more beneficial for these students.\n\nBut finally, they also talk about the financial responsibility that they can gain through the motion. But we think that this ends up in like two spectrums. It's either you waste off all your salary on bubble tea or like your parents take all the cash. Right. So in the end, we don't think the high schoolers are capable and nor is it feasible for them to gain this kind of financial responsibility once they start doing a part-time job.\n\nSo let's look at the comparative. Right. What can we actually gain by preventing them from doing part-time jobs? We think that by focusing on your school life, whether it's like academic or whether it's something to do with clubs, we think that this has like a long term benefit on the students because first of all, they gain these kinds of soft skills, right? Like communication skills or like teamwork or like learning to respect your seniors or like fulfilling your role in like a team or like leadership and like other other skills.\n\nAnd let's look at like academic skills. Right. So again, let's take their best case and say that like most students don't go to university anyway. So academic skills are important. We think that like firstly, we think that academic skills are not necessarily like getting into that university or having like an elite record. We think that like even if you don't go to university in the end, like working hard to get that good grade on the test or like studying and like sharing your thoughts together with your peers is in itself like a valuable experience. Even if you don't go to university in the future. \n\nAnd compared to that, the kind of like tedious and repetitive manual labor that you're going to experience through a part-time job is like a meaningless act. And that doesn't lead to any useful skills compared to what you could gain from working hard studying.\n\nSo all in all, regardless of what kind of future that you are going into for the long term benefit and the happiness of the students as a whole, we think that they should never experience part-time jobs during their high school career. And that is why we're so proud to oppose. Thank you."", 7: ""Part-time jobs are an easier way for students to learn social skills. At a point that the manners are written and they have to behave responsibly, and they can learn how to use the money. At this point, we strongly believe today's motion. So, today we have two main points here. The first point is about the academic skills, and the second point is about the social skills.\n\nSo, first, let me talk about the academic skills. We believe that the students can also maintain a balance between the part-time jobs and studying. So, high school students have enough chance to think of the future. No one will do a part-time job all day when the entrance exam will be held two months later. So, they will be able to maintain the balance between studying and part-time job. \n\nAnd this is also done when it comes to club activities. Students are able to maintain, even now, the balance between studying and club activities, which is club activities are the same as part-time jobs. At a point that they spend about 10 hours a week, which is completely different from studying. We believe that they can maintain the balance between the part-time jobs and studying. And if they cannot do that, it can also be said that they cannot maintain the balance between club activities and studying. So, we believe that there will be no difference between the people who are doing club activities and people who are doing the part-time jobs and club activities.\n\nNext, let me talk about the social skills, which is the most important thing in the participation. So, they said that they can learn a lot of social skills in the club activities. They said that they can learn how to behave against seniors. However, they can learn a lot of social skills, for example, how to behave against senior people. However, we believe that club activities are completely different from part-time jobs. To the point that they can quit easily the club activities when they have some difficulty in the club activities. \n\nAnd also, the rules are not written. So, it is difficult for students to know the rules. Feeling the atmosphere and changing behavior is so difficult for high school students. On the other hand, in part-time jobs, first of all, the manners are written. So, it is easier for students to learn social skills because they can learn the manners while they are doing part-time jobs because the manners are written.\n\nThe second point is that they have to behave responsibly, and they can somehow find a way to get along with who they hate. And the salary can be a huge motivation for these kinds of things which cannot be done when they are in the club activities. Because if there are some people they hate, they can quit easily. But salary can be a huge motivation in the part-time jobs.\n\nThe third thing is about how to use money. So, what will happen if they do not do part-time jobs in high school and they just get a lot of huge money when they are in the universities? So, when they are in the universities, they can do a lot of part-time jobs and they will get a lot of money. However, there is no one who can tell the importance and tell how to use the money. So, at the point when they are high school students, parents can control to some extent. \n\nAnd this is important because the parents can realize, can make them know how it is important to use and how they can truly use the money for themselves. And in this point, we believe that the social skills gained by the part-time jobs are bigger than only done in the club activities. So, that's why we strongly believe this motion. Thank you.""}"
15,【政治家の私生活報道】mixidea定期高校練習,THBT media should not report on the private lives of politicians.,"{0: ""We agree that politicians have the power to change society through policies, but what we don't agree is the politicians becoming public property, where every single action is determined by the public, where the paparazzi is justified in walking around and, for instance, hacking into their phones and looking at private documents for the sake of their own profit. We think it is inherently unjust for the media to try and pry into the private lives of politicians at the expense where they could potentially have children or families who didn't consent to these behaviors. So I'm very happy to propose. \n\nLet me start off by explaining our stance. Three parts. First, is that we would define private lives as the world in which these politicians or members that are part of the private lives didn't give consent to. Realize that this is inherently different from public lives, which is literally their job as a politician, so we think that private lives are inherently the elements of life that are irrelevant to one's action of doing a job. \n\nAnd secondly, we would define media as anything that looks like social media, we think it could look at any kind of newspaper or magazine, we think it doesn't matter. \n\nAnd thirdly, is that we think that in instances of corruption, these are instances that are involved in security, and this is an issue that is involved in their own jobs as a politician, so we think in the case of corruption, we think that's kind of irrelevant to this debate, so we think that in those instances, that's basically a public matter for society.\n\nSo we think opposition really needs to defend the micro nuances of private lives, for instance, of which newspaper they walk to, or what house, where they live, or what kind of house they live in. That's the kind of comparison we want to make.\n\nGiven this, I'm going to bring you two arguments. First, I'm going to explain to you why politicians have a right to private lives, and secondly, I'll be explaining why this is bad for public discourse. \n\nFirst, let's look at why politicians have a right to private lives. Two reasons. First, is because we think that this is just a natural reaction of the rights we give. Because if you look at the status quo, politicians are given some certain extent of protection. For instance, they have the right to property, that is that we don't allow people to access their bank accounts or invade someone's house. Why? Because we think this is information that is inherently only relevant and important to that specific person, and people around them don't have a right to know it. \n\nWhat does this suggest? This suggests that this motion is just a natural extension of the rights we give. For instance, we think that there is no justification or any kind of need for the public sphere to know which politician goes out to eat with, what kind of things they do with their children or their family, and we think that it is unjust for the media to just pry on specific and wavy information for the sake of their own. \n\nWe think it is just in saying that these politicians should be able to live a life where they don't have to fear paparazzi escaping around, at the point in which we already give certain rights. We think this is just a natural extension, we see no problem. \n\nBut B, is because politicians never consented to this in the first place, right? Because we think the private lives are inherently elements of life that these politicians didn't give consent to, right? At the point in which we infringe consent, even at the bypass of one instance, we say this is a slippery slope, with at the moment in which the media can infringe upon the consent of an individual, we allow the media, for instance, barge into houses or looking at private documents of a policy, and we think this is never justified, and at the moment in which we should never cross the line of consent. \n\nBut let's take the best case scenario of politicians, that is that politicians don't really care about their private lives, so we should be able to do whatever we want to do. Even if politicians still gave some consent, we think that it's still not legitimate. Why? Because we think that other factors and other variables are included in private lives, who didn't consent to this in the equation. For instance, it could look like family members, or friends, or children who didn't agree to having their every single action being exposed by the media. \n\nWe think that it is inherently justified to not report on the private lives when there are third-party harms. We think it is unjustified for a politician's wife to be surrounded by cameras every single day asking about a potential scandal of a politician, where innocent children are trying to be asked by popularity every single day of how they think their dad is, right? We think that those kind of third-party harms, at the point in which they didn't consent to these kind of behaviors in the first place, we think the media never has a justification. \n\nGiven that politicians have a right to private lives, why should this override the authority of the media? Which is probably going to be the argument coming from opposition. Two reasons. First, is that we think that the role of media should not be provoking or inciting these kind of issues in the first place. Why? Because we think the media should be news that just shows reliable information and not try to create some fake news in the first place. \n\nWe think that what's going to happen in the status quo is that these medias are going to be profit-incentivized and they're going to sensationalize issues. So we're very able to see situations where these media or newspapers are going to aggravate a politician and broadcast them in a very false way and try to incite violence and portray these politicians as someone that is radical or sexist or homophobic. \n\nRealize that these private issues of sensationalization are different from public issues like corona or murder because these issues are inherently public. And these public issues mean that it's very easy for the public to say, to see if this is fake or not. But the problem of this sensationalization of private lives is that there's no other source to determine the credibility. So that means that the public is only able to trust that piece of unreliable source and take it as true. So even if a politician is not racist or homophobic, if a media tries to broadcast their private lives as being racist, then everyone believes the politician is racist and we think that's inherently evil. \n\nBut B, we think the private lives are irrelevant to the public actors, public actions of politicians. We think that as a politician, you do have a duty to give good policies and cater for society. But we think that what they do at home, their own actions and private lives are irrelevant to the public matters. \n\nGiven this, we think the public doesn't have the justification to have access to private lives because whatever these politicians do in private is absolutely irrelevant to the actions of politicians do in public. Given this, we say the privacy outweighs authority of media.\n\nMy second argument is that this is going to be bad for political discourse. What does this mean and why is this the case? Because first, we would have two reasons. \n\nFirst is because we think that there are many instances where politicians want to keep something secret to maintain fairness. What does this mean? Because we think that the world we're going to see if media reports on the private lives of politicians is that if a politician is trying to gain votes, despite being very fair and equal, what's going to happen is that if they're found to be homosexual, they're going to lose votes in very conservative communities. We think this is bad because we think that we're going to have fair politicians being kicked out of office just by some racial bias. We think that those kind of issues are unjustified for the sake of political discourse. \n\nWe think that politicians should have a right to act in a good public sphere. And we think that what their own self-identity shouldn't be bashed out for the sake of the public. \n\nBut secondly, is that politics is going to be a dirty game. That is, the politician is just not really going to care about the policies they make, but rather just try to make a good persona and a personality for the sake of the state. \n\nAnd but secondly, what's going to happen furthermore is that these politicians are just going to try to throw dirt at other politicians, saying that some politicians committed adultery, even if it's not true, saying that one politician is racist. We think that inherently, politicians should just care about the policies they make and not about that behavior they do in private. \n\nGiven this, we think that this is going to be bad for political discourse because politicians are now going to have an incentive to not care about policies, but rather to just shut down competition for other politicians. Given this, we think politicians have a right to private lives. They're no different from us. We think they should be able to live in peace. I'm very happy to propose."", 1: ""As the opposition side, in the age distinction between personal lives and political lives of positions is becoming unclear and like in the age where government has control over other related institutions. We think that media is the only way to prevent corrections and achieve real democracy. First of all, we'll talk about why it is justified. And secondly, we will talk about how those reports are critical for democracy.\n\nSo first of all, we say that they have talked about the traffic privacy rights for the politicians, but we have several responses.\n\nFirst of all, we say that politicians can always sue media if they feel that media reported something so terrible, but we say that that decision should not be up to the government; whether media should report that information should be decided by courts, not the government itself because the government can always sue, like personal lives and exploit it to protect politicians who are committing corruptions. So we're not completely taking away private privacy rights.\n\nSecond of all, we say that medias have no incentive to disclose personal information of people around politicians because what people are interested in is what politicians do or whether the politicians are morally good or not. So, point you can always like put A or B instead of reporting the real name of my politician's friends or family, or like they can always sue. Instead of reporting the real name of my politician's friends or family, or like they can always put some mosaics on the face of the families of politicians. \n\nWe're saying that those concerns of the government are not going to be real but even if we take the best case of the government's light and say that like media sensationalizes like sexual identity oppositions and like elections are going to be biased, we don't think like that's the reason to support this motion.  For example, already in elections, women are being discriminated, right? Because they put their names. They put their faces. And that's enough for people to know that they're women and they're being discriminated. We don't think this is a unique problem to this reporting personal rights.\n\nAnd moreover, we say if that one politician turned out to be LGBTQ like he might. He or she might lose the votes from non-LGBTQ supporters but he will gain votes from LGBTQ supporters and we don't think this is better for discourse.\n\nMoving on to the second argument, how it is good for democracy. So first of all, I'll start by capitalizing media. The first thing we say amongst the institutions that are able to disclose influence about politicians, for example, such as government itself or police, etc. Media is the most far from government, which means that media is least likely to be controlled by the government, like we can see that like court is already being controlled by government, and it is easy to say that all the other organizations are going to be controlled by the government.\n\nSecond of all, what media point about politicians? Two things, first of all, they report whether they are moral. For example, they might report that the politician is committing DV to his wife or something. Then the people will know that those politicians are not eligible to talk about women's rights in parliament or like in the recent example, we can see that media reported that Mr. Kurokawa went out during quarantine and that can help people know that policymakers don't care about the role point they make.\n\nAnd second of all, they report connections between politicians. For example, like Mr. A and Miss B went out to a secret dinner party at like the western sea. This is something that is doubtful. Of course, politicians themselves will claim this is personal life and this is what the government side has said. But how like you don't know when like those personal dinner parties turn into political like corrupting meeting, right? So it is in so-called personal meetings that all the connections begin. So like after all, no one can plan a scheme in the official government building, right? So it's likely that politicians are exploiting world personal lives to actually do corruptions.\n\nSo what is it is like in the opposition side's world? So first of all, people can know about politicians' corruptions or morality and this is critical for like rational judging and voting because this is important because democracy is about receiving enough necessary information and voting. And we say that those morality of politicians is a critical information for that, because politicians are someone who represents people. \n\nAnd if the politician force people some kind of moral obligation or law and but they themselves don't conform it, we can say that politicians are just enjoying privilege by being politicians. Meaning they're just receiving money and pretending to be helping people and people know that those politicians don't care about people they're responsible. they don't care about what people will suffer or like people will benefit from their policies. If so no one will want to vote for them, right?\n\nBut in the government side as well because no one will disclose the information about morality or corruption people can't know about this and if the government's if this motion is taken the worst thing more worse things gonna happen because the government can always threaten media saying that hey, this is personal lives. Don't report this. So corruption is going to be more income under their world. So therefore we are proud to oppose.\n"", 2: ""Let's be very clear about what this debate is about, because this debate is not about a politician who has raped tens of women, because those are crimes and those are likely to be already prosecuted by the state. We think that the sort of politicians that are likely to be the main context of this debate are the ones who have committed adultery, for instance, or who have hidden the fact that they are homosexual in an extremely conservative area where they have the danger of being beaten up in the street and being the subject to conversion therapy. Those are the people we are protecting in this debate, and those are the people that the opposition, at the start of this debate, have ignored.\n\nSo, I'm going to introduce our third substantive, which is how we increase the quality of political discussion inside the parliament, but before moving on, I have a number of responses to the side of the opposition.\n\nFirstly, the leader of the opposition says that this is justified because governments can, like on our side of the house, governments can redefine what the private life is, to effectively protect politicians who are corrupted. That's not the case, because this debate is not about state preventing media from doing something, because this is a value judgement debate, and this debate should be based on objectively whether or not media should do X, right? So this is clearly out of this debate.\n\nBut then they say, oh, the corruption is going to happen on our side of the house. But the important thing we need to note here is that we don't need to infringe on the privacy of politicians, we don't need to know what they're doing, whether or not they are committing adultery, in order to check what the money for the governmental subsidy to a political party has been used, right? We think that those are the public lives, which the media can legitimately check on the side of the politician, right? So there's always a check and balance system that exists on our side of the house. So clearly, that is out of this debate.\n\nBut then they say, in case of the infringement of privacy for families, we can always have mosaic. First of all, I think we have made this clear from the start of this debate, that media is likely to sensationalize at the point where it is actually beneficial to publish the very private lives of politicians, right? Because this is slippery slope, at the point where media is allowed to report whether or not some individual have committed adultery in the past is the point where they are likely to also publish the picture of them in the prom in high school, for instance. And then this extent goes on and goes on and goes on. So I think that eventually, in the long run, media will no longer have mosaic on your side of the house. But plus, you don't have a fear to say that the media is going to do this.\n\nSecondly, because the fact that people, for instance, in conservative, extremely conservative area, know that this politician is a homosexual, it's not just about that they're going to lose votes, but it's also the question of survival. That is to say that even in the liberal context of the United States, there are 160 cases reported of conversion therapy, which is extremely traumatic for the homosexual individual. \n\nNow, the reason why those politicians hide their own identity in the first place is because they think it's worse for those individuals. So precisely, precisely by that logic, I think that the vast majority of context in this debate is a homosexual individual in conservative area, not in liberal area, because if those individuals are in liberal area, they would have presumably already come out of the closet as the leader of the opposition say that they can get more LGBT votes, right? So precisely for that logic, I think that it's false.\n\nBut then they say, so again, on the weird and coward response that we got from the leader of the opposition about how LGBT candidates can get votes from LGBT individual. This is already responded by two response; conversion therapy plus in conservative area. \n\nBut then they say, oh, this is a critical information for democracy. But they have never explained to us why an immoral politician can't pass a law that criminalizes sexual harassment, if that's what people want, right? The ability for politician to fairly represent the view of individual, view of citizen is independent of whether or not they have committed adultery in the past, right? \n\nI think we can make it very clear, because I think what matters is how those politicians act in the public sphere, which is exactly the information that currently people can assess, right?For instance, I think that it's very clear that the voters have dozens of opportunities to interact with politicians in real life and face-to-face, right? Local community, so for instance, in the United States, politicians approximately spend more than 60% of their working hours going to supporters house and going to community center and interact with the voters, right, in order to get the crucial voter in order to be re-elected in the next election. \n\nSo there are plenty of opportunities for those individuals who are genuinely caring about politics to be able to interact with politicians, thus being able to know about the very minor details of those individuals, right? The distinction we have to draw is that whether or not those politicians have actually consented to this disclosure of information, that is a crucial point we're making in this debate.\n\nBut finally, I want to add one thing to our argument about politics, right? One layer of mechanism as to why media is likely to use this tactic, so debunk the private lives of politicians, of opponents of politicians, actually. For instance, conservative media actively marginalizing liberal side of politicians in order to get the politics to be more conservative, right? \n\nSo why is this a powerful tool for media to effectively marginalize politicians? Because there's a confirmation bias. For example, when a media broadcasts a picture of a politician who advocates to support the poor, wearing the thousand dollar suit in their vacation, for instance, even if that picture was photoshopped, for instance, people are going to effectively and immediately tie that politician with the image of being greedy at the point where that image is planted in people's mind, subconscious mind, is a point where even if that politician says that it's not true, it's a photoshopped picture, it seems like a pathetic attempt for that politician because you are a bad guy from the eye of the public. \n\nSo I think we can all be clear that there are perverse incentives for media organizations, actually, especially conservative media organizations, to actively disenfranchise the liberal side of politicians and vice versa. So I think the politics is not going to focus on the policy and what the good for the society actually is, but more of the personal side of each politician and the image control, and it's going to be a really dirty game. \n\nSo on to first, how it increases the quality of political discussion. I think we made it clear that the premise of this argument is that politicians' ability and how good a politician is at their job is independent from their personal life and how they act in the private sphere. And with that in mind, I think that the competitiveness of the job of politician is likely to increase on our side of the house for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, it's because being a politician, there are already a lot of hurdles on being a politician. For instance, the responsibility that comes with it or potential backlash that you're likely to get. The fact that media actively debunks private lives of politicians means that there will be more disincentive for people not to become politicians. \n\nSecondly, it increases the accessibility of people to become politicians because people who have committed something immoral, maybe, can't be a political candidate immediately in the first place. \n\nSo this increase in competitiveness means that we get politicians who better represent the will of the people. That means we get a far better form of democracy on our side of the house. For that reason, we want to protect the privacy of politicians. We want the politics to be better on our side of the house. Very proud to propose."", 3: ""We believe that the most important thing in politics is preventing collapse by raising the politician's consciousness, and media in itself have rights to report what is related to your public interest and is helpful for citizens to electing politicians.\n\nSo before moving to my argument, I'm going to refute to the government side. So what the government side said is that there is no legislation to report the politician's private life because there is no consent and also includes your family members, but this is not true because under the status quo, media itself does not report your really private life. What the media is doing is, like, because media is not reporting, like, his children go to some surgeon's school or something, or he is dating with someone, media is not reporting such kind of thing because this is not related to the citizen's interest.\n\nAnd what media report is a private thing but relating to the policy to some extent. So, for example, like, some politicians are appealing to certain authority or certain private company members, or like, he or she had a trip in disastrous situations or such kind of thing, but we think people have the right to know because we think that people have the right to know the beginning of corruption, and media have the right to report those kinds of things.\n\nSecond part is that, like, homosexual politicians will be attacked by non-LGBTQ supporters, but we think media will not disclose this kind of really sexual thing because media have never disclosed such kind of thing, and also media will not discriminate those politicians because if media does discriminate because they are LGBTQ, there will be a lot of criticism by citizens, because many people see media and people, there are many people who support LGBTQ, and those people will really criticize those media, and then media lose credit. So media have no incentive to discriminate those kinds of people\n\nAnd even if media disclose those kinds of, report those kinds of points, they earn a lot of supporters, the politicians will earn a lot of supporters. Because for example, under the status quo, Komeito is supported by Soka Gakkai, it is a religious institution, community, but that's why, that's why Komeito have a lot of powers, and what I wanna tell from this example is those who have the same thoughts, or who have the same religious, or who have the same sexual thoughts, will be supported, will be strongly supported by the same group.\n\nSo, moving on to my argument, so first of all, I'm gonna talk about politicians will be conscious, and second of all, media have rights. \n\nSo first, we believe politicians should be the good role model, good, good acting model for citizens, because the politicians should, are elected by citizens, and politicians have to keep the rule, so the voting owns your private life, you make them more conscious about their behavior, also private life reflects your personality, so people are easily understood by citizens, or you'll easily understand their personality, their candidates, or like, their politics, politics personality, larger than government. \n\nFirstly, why knowing personality is important, people are like, because people have to elect, or people have rights to elect politicians, so, because, and, it is, our, really, democracy.\n\n<POI> So, why is interacting with that political candidate from your local voter bloc insufficient, knowing whether or not that person is actually trustworthy for individuals who genuinely want to participate in the world of politics? \n\nBecause what people have to know about their personality, is because then people can decide who he or she is worth of credit, or something.\n\nSo moving on to my speech. So, in government paradigm, people lose the chance to know about those kinds of personality, your personality, and people have, people have rights to know that in order to choose, choose their lawfully person for the parliament, parliamentary.\n\n And second of all, people can know about the faction in each party or know about advocation with certain people or private companies. It is significant because on this data pool, many politicians, some politicians giving money illegally, or prioritizing their friend's company, but this, without media, people can't, people can't know about them, and police will not search this kind of thing because what police do is some accident happens, or some people witness some accident, and then they're going to research.\n\nBut media is not, it's not doing such kind of thing because media will be more flexible to those kinds of things. And in the government paradigm, since the media can't report their private life, citizens will lose the chance to know that, and because media lose incentive to research about that, so politics will be collapsed in government power line.\n\nAnd so in our paradigm, we can achieve, we can stick together who are highly motivated politicians, who are willing to be good model for a person, like keeping those are morally good person. So, so for these reasons, we are happy to propose, thank you."", 4: ""Opposition's stance in saying that the distinction between private and public lives is very unclear is not a substitute and not a justification for the media to be able to report on every single action of politicians. \n\nI'm going to examine two areas of clash. First, does the media have justification? And secondly, I'm going to look at the effects on politics.\n\nFirst, let's look at whether media has justification. And let me number out what opposition really talked about, but it realized in the first place that opposition never really gave a constructive argument, but most of their talk was basically built upon rebuttals to our constructive. So if we mitigate the rebuttals, we say at the moment in which they don't have any constructive impact to fall back on, we say that we should win this debate.\n\nA is that first the problem with what opposition first told us is the distinction between media and government, because there's somehow stance coming from leader of opposition was that, hey, that governments like governments should not be able to report on the private lives of politicians, but media can because media is more reliable than the government. This is an absurd argument to come up with because in terms of authority, governments is the ones that are passing policies that are giving laws that say that these politicians have a right to privacy. So the moment in which opposition is willing to concede that the government doesn't have authority to report on the private lives, and we say similarly, just in terms of authority, the media should similarly not be able to report on private lives.\n\nBut B is that they refuted against our argument saying that these other individuals involved aren't really related because one, we have a mosaic, and two, that media has no incentive to do so. Realize that in the first place, they never refuted our main premise about politicians themselves not giving consent. Opposition needs to engage with this main crux because this was an argument that was a sub nuance of our main argument. They need to say why even if politicians didn't give consent to, why the media is justified in doing so.\n\nBut let's take their best of consent to other individuals. Notice that you're only able to determine whether a politician is, quote, quote, coming from opposition is good or morally a good person, morally capable person, is through interpersonal relationships. That means that you need to know how they behave through their relationships with other people, how they treat other members of society. And in order to find that out, then inevitably you need to report on the private lives of other members that are in the sphere of the private lives of politicians. Given this, we think that these other individuals didn't give consent, and we think the media has no perverse incentive to only look at the politicians themselves.\n\nBut B, notice that when they talk about mosaic, that's not really, that's a really weird stance to take by. Because if their stance was that, hey, the public and private lives is becoming very unclear, so we should be justified in like breaking that apart, then if they're okay with just simply going with mosaic, I don't really see why the media won't be justified in not reporting on mosaic or hiding up names. And I think, rather, if they're saying that security should be maintained to some certain extent, I don't know why it cannot go, why it cannot go to the extent where media should not report on the private lives of any instances. The moment in which you draw an unclear line is the moment in which opposition will still be.\n\nBut lastly, most importantly, is that they said that, hey, this is okay in the case of preventing corruption. This argument is the most absurd but most important thing I want you to know in my speech. That is that I think it's extremely disrespectful to substitute minor cases and categorize all politicians as potentially being corrupt or someone that commits adultery. Because their logic was that, hey, that if no one is looking, then these politicians are going to be able to do whatever they want to do. Look, people won't commit domestic violence just because you have the capability of doing so. We say politicians in general are usually good people who care for society. That's literally the reason why they become politicians, because they want to create policies and make people happy. So it's important to note that opposition's label of all politicians are bad is bad.\n\nBut secondly, this, what they're suggesting as a policy is analogous to, for instance, these people might be committing a crime, so let's invade their house and check. Look, realize that people are proven innocent until guilty, and this is something that is intuitively correct because we can't just suddenly label a person as guilty without evidence. What they are suggesting is in sake of a potential crime, then we should be able to infringe upon privacy, their consent. \n\nAnd we think this is extremely bad because this is going to lead to a slippery slope in a line where the media can do whatever they want to do for some baseless potential of crime. We kept on talking about, and this clashes directly with our arguments about political discourse, because we think it's important that the media should never be able to just do whatever they want to do because of some hypothetical myth that these people have created themselves. \n\nGiven this, media has no justification, but at the moment in which they never engage with their material about how they never gave consent and that they already have a given certain protection in terms of, for instance, like privacy, in terms of bank accounts or house. We think opposition never really was able to engage this. And at this moment, we say the media has never a justification.\n\nBut secondly, let's look at the effects on politics. The first thing that opposition suggested was that, hey, that if we expose the identity of politicians, then they might lose some like supporters from non-LGBT, but they'll gain support from LGBTQ members. I think it is important to note that the media should not be the actor that determines what is good for the politicians, because on our side, we're very happy for politicians to come out and expose their identity if they think it's good for them. \n\nBut we don't think that the media is justified in substituting the politicians' opinions and forcibly exposing the identity, especially in instances of conservative communities, the examples that we told you, because this simply is unjust. I think it is important that opposition is the one that is suggesting that the media should always be the one that determines what politicians want. \n\nI think the politicians should have some certain choice of whether they want to expose their identity of their own.\n\nBut B, is that their characterization of role model. I have two responses. First is that I don't really see the need for politicians becoming role models in the first place, because politicians are not social influencers that determine what kind of people, like the best ideal person that a normal citizen wants to be. Because we think that the inherently job and the point of a politician is to create policies and laws that are good for society. So there's really no need for the general public to have a politician as a role model. And we think that this isn't a justification for the media to report in the first place.\n\nBut B, is that let's take them at their best and that there are individuals that cater, they want to become like these politicians. We think in those instances, that's still capable on our side. Like the POI that Kotaro gave to DLO, that was that we have enough opportunities to engage for these individuals, such as local voting blocs, because you see politicians walking around in the streets and seeing what they are like. I think that's enough of these politicians to act. And I think that that again, is not a substitute for a constructive argument for opposition.\n\nAnd lastly, is the case about corruption. I think it is important to note that we already said in our model that corruption, domestic violence is irrelevant in this debate in the first place, because those are public issues related to criminal law. And it's important that opposition can't really defend these cases because that's simply out of the debate.\n\nLastly, I want you to note the lack of engagement because there was never a response coming to you about how there's going to be worse or politicians and politicians becoming basically a competition of throwing dirt like Trump did to Hillary in elections for Pizzagate. I think it is important to note the politicians are going to be severely worse on their opposition side. I'm very happy to propose."", 5: 'We have a right to watch the politicians behave and are certain whatever that behave is whether that behave is appropriate or not because society always stands on democracy and democracy is also made by electing or supporting by citizens.\n\nI\'m going to move on to the rebuttal. First, the goevrnment side said that ""to report private life of politivians is not justified, because this information is very private, and to judge this so difficult."" but LO defined that the private lives are not like where they live or something. These pieces of information are uncomfortable for us. And in this debate, we talk about more relevant to citizens and police and relevant to policy. And this is also relevant to people. And the people, the people considering got the point of democracy. \n\nAnd this also causes social discourse. I\'m going to talk about this later. And about the LGBT issue. If politicians say discriminative things about LGBTQ, media can report, and this also causes social discourse. \n\nAnd so I\'m going to reconstruction of our side. We have the right to know about government information so that we can make our lives better. And in the election, to change governments, the part of politicians\' behavior, we should know the worst part of politicians\' behavior. If we know about it, we have to restart. We don\'t know that because we can\'t believe him, and we can\'t entrust him with government managing point.\n\nAnd these days, now coronavirus spread all over the world. This situation is very serious, and the government requested them to stay home. But in this situation, if a politician travels somewhere with his or her family, this is personal information, but media should report to us because this is involved with citizens, and citizens can\'t ascertain whether the behavior is appropriate or not. \n\nIn this example, everyone may think that we can\'t trust him and we can\'t entrust him to manage member government. So to report personal life of a politician is also to give social discourse to society. So this is the benefit by taking this motion.\n\nAnd to report personal life of a politician is to give social discourse, and so if we take this motion, we can give social discourse to society. And this also makes there\'s a better government by standing on democracy. So, we shouldn\'t take this motion, thank you.', 6: ""As the leader of the opposition reply, we would like to strongly oppose this motion. Firstly, we will have another look at the constructive matters in the debate. And after that, we will talk about the main clash in this debate.\n\nSo the first thing of construction is why our side's capitalization of politicians is just. So the government side has talked about how to claim that the opposition side is characterizing politicians as bad people. But we don't, but they missed our nuance. Because what we are saying is that politicians are just in the environment that their moral failures can be concealed by governmental power over other institutions. We are not saying that politicians' personal, like principles, personality is corrupt. We think that they are just in the environment that makes politicians' failure invisible.\n\nSo, second of all, they have talked about how discourse is going to be confused. But their argument was weak. Because as the opposition pointed out, media can work both ways. It is wrong to say that media only commit outing or like make sensations in a bad way. \n\nMedia can make sensations in a good way also. As the opposition side can say, media can report offensive statements towards the LGBTQ community or whatsoever. And we say that merely the fact that media can work in a good way is enough to justify the reporting of personal life of politicians. Because in case that media caused bad sensations, then as we have already said, politicians can sue media or something like that. \n\nBut what we hear is like the situations where politicians have complete control over what they make public about their principles and like concealing the biases that they themselves have.\n\nSo, moving on to the main class of today, it is whether like personality can be the criteria of judgment in voting. So, we are weighing the privacy rights of politicians and weighing the rights for the people to know about the personality of the politicians. So, we can compare these two in terms of whether we have an alternative to protect that actor. \n\nWe already said that no one other than media is willing to report about politicians' wealth failures. And the only response we got was that people can interact personally with the politicians. But do you think that politicians will say offensive things in front of their daughters? No. And we don't think also that people are willing to interact with every single politician. \n\nAnd compared to that, in case of privacy rights, we have already shown how we can minimize that harm or how politicians can sue media. That's why our arguments outweigh their arguments. We are more than happy to oppose."", 7: ""What we said from the start of this debate was very simple, right? We don't need to know whether or not politicians have committed adultery in the past, or whether or not they are homosexual, or even this tiny detail of what could tell those politicians stayed in their family trips, right? All of those private informations that politicians do not disclose by themselves are the private information that must be protected on our side of the house.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm going to talk about two things. Firstly, on privacy. Secondly, on democracy.\n\nFirstly, on privacy. The opposition side merely asserted that the people should be able to know without explaining to us why the right to know actually overrides the privacy that we have been talking about in this debate. We told you from the start of this debate, the very tangible harms that come with the intrusion of privacy by media organisations that are critical not only to politicians but also to politicians' families.\n\nNow, there are reasons to believe that the individual's rights and the individual's rights to privacy actually override the right to know. For instance, I think it's clear that the media organisation always gets consent before using any videos in which a person is shot, for instance. You always get explicit consent from the person because those individuals are portrayed, right? This is analogous to what we are talking about in this debate. We think that individuals have the right to privacy, have the right to consent to what extent that information is actually available to the public, and that media absolutely must obey this principle.\n\nThe only response we got from the side of opposition was about the LGBT example. This is practically the only thing that they have revised. They say, but firstly, it's not enough to negate our point.\n\nBut secondly, they tell us that you get votes from LGBT at the point where you say that you're a homosexual individual, you found out that you're a homosexual individual, but then they also say that media won't make offensive comments on being homosexual. \n\nThey completely miss the nuance from our argument, right? We said that this debate, even those individuals actively hide the fact that they're being homosexual means that they're presumably in conservative areas where they have high likelihood of being the subject of conversion therapy or being subject to arbitrary discrimination. Now, the harm is also that arbitrary discrimination, conversion therapy, but also imagine what happens when you are a dear Christian and the person that you have voted for in the last election turned out to be gay that you think is a sin. It's the point where those individuals absolutely go furious with those individuals. We think the amount of backlash those homosexual candidates get is enormous on their side of the house.\n\nMoving on to the democracy point, they said two things. Firstly, about the corruption. This was merely an assertion, but secondly, we have rebutted from the start of this debate that this is an irrelevant thing in this debate and we got no responses.\n\nSecondly, they asked about the right to know. This was again a mere assertion, but secondly, even if politicians are so morally egregious to the extent that they're really bad individuals, I think the fact that in the public sphere, they have not found out that they're morally egregious individuals already shows that in the public sphere, they can control their own behaviour, right?\n\nWhat's important as a politician is not whether or not you're actually a good individual, but rather how you act in the public sphere, how you act when you meet the president of another country. Those are the important skills that politicians must have and the public must be able to assess. All of this information can be accumulated from individuals on our side of the house through interacting with those individuals face-to-face in the community centre if you're particularly interested in politics.\n\nBut let's take them at their best case scenario, which is that the right to know actually exists and right to know completely exists, right? Note that this is contingent on the assumption that the media on their side of the house will equally report private lives of every politician, thus people are fully informed of it. \n\nThat's not possible because we told you in our second argument that presumably liberal media will focus on conservative politicians' private scandal for instance, so there will be a subjective control of information available to the public from the media organisation. So the harm is fairly symmetric even if we take their best case scenario. For all these reasons, please do not intrude the fundamental right that the politician has. Very proud to propose.""}"
16,【民営化 vs 国営化】mixidea高校定期練習,THW nationalize porn industry.,"{0: ""Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, three substantial points from the Prime Minister. Firstly, in the status quo, the privatization of the porn industry does harm to the sexual culture and the porn actress. And secondly, in this policy, it decreases the radicalization of the sex culture and saves many porn actresses. Thirdly, in the comparison, even if the privatization of the porn industry makes a diversified satisfaction of the particular target, the state doesn't prioritize these people. Also, we have to prioritize to save the porn culture.\n\nSo, before that, there are several models to our side of the house. Firstly, we ban all forms of the private porn industry, such as porn videos and porn websites and sex stories and so forth. And the discontent of the porn things by the state only makes it conscious of the not illegal things, not so immoral things, such as sex with the child or sex with the drug and so forth. These kinds of illegal or immoral things are never made by the state. That is the stance from our side of the house.\n\nMoving on to my substantial. The privatization of the porn industry does harm to the sexual culture and the porn actress. In the status quo, due to the diversity of the privatization of the porn industry, many corporations want to make the profit. And they make many diversified videos, such as the rape video and the pedophilia video and these kinds of immoral videos and so forth. Why is that? The reason is very simple. Basically, the profit-seekers want to get the profit by the many numbers of people. Because if they just focus on the particular target, this profit is not maximized in the first place. That's the reason why the profit-seekers, in order to maximize the profit, they also make these very diversified videos. \n\n<POI> We are proud to restrict those kinds of rape and radical videos. And we are trying to push those entertainment as a porn industry. What do you think about that?\n\nFirstly, it's impossible to completely supervise this porn industry. Because if the state also makes the right to make this porn industry, some porn industries also make these illegal things. If an illegal thing is banned in the aftermath, that data is at least spread in some terms. That's why the most important thing is that preemptively we don't make that kind of thing. That's the reason why that solution is only nationalized by the porn industry. Secondly, we are talking about why this privatization of this porn industry makes harm to the porn actors.\n\nNow, this porn industry, there are many numbers of porn industry. Also, there are many people who want to be porn actors. That's why the value of the porn actors is decreasing now in the past. Because if some people criticize this corporation, our wage is very low. That time, corporations easily cut off these porn actors because there are a number of unacceptable people in the past. Now, these porn actors also have to work with a very hard environment. For example, there are very bad environments without their guardians. That's the reason why in the status quo, it's very harmful to these porn actors.\n\nSecondly, why did this policy decrease the many radicalization of the sex culture and saving these many actors? Because now, the supervisor is the state. That's why the state never makes this violent content. Because if the state makes the violent content, this criticism is very large compared to this private industry. Because also, many of the citizens, many of the stakeholders, are always supervised by the state itself. That's why states also don't have the possibility to make violent content in the past. That's why compared to the status quo, we can only make moderate content of the porn industry. \n\nSecondly, also we can guarantee the value of the porn actors. Because also, the state is not a profit seeker, and also they have much money compared to the private industry. That's why also the state can't guarantee good environment for these porn actors. That's why if these porn actors become the disease, also the state can't guarantee to go to the hospital. Also, they can't save the future of the porn actors. That's the reason why compared to the status quo, this environment of the porn actors is very good in the first place. That's why this policy can decrease the radicalization of the sex culture to save the porn actors.\n\nFinally, in the conclusion, even if the privatization of the porn industry makes the diversity and the satisfaction of the particular target, why the state doesn't privatize them? This is a valid judgment. We think that also the state also has to maximize the people's happiness and satisfaction. But in the status quo, some number of these porn videos also make the next harm to other people, or make the victim in the past. Because in the existence of the rape video, in the existence of the pedophilia video, some number of people see it, and after that, they mimic this video in the first place. And after the mimicking, they also upload this video to the porn website, for example, Poisonous or something, in the first place. \n\nThat's why, ladies and gentlemen, as long as this content makes a new victim, and this victim can't stand up to the future, we don't privatize this value for these people. That's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that, compared to the satisfaction of the variety of types of people, to protect the sex culture and protect the sex actors is very important. For those reasons, we are proud to support Poison."", 1: ""Porn industry is a thing which have like careful like action, have like careful preparation, in order to, like, in order to save like those kind of actors, or to make entertainment for every like citizens in today's society right. So, in today's debate, we have a certain question right, can like the state have like appropriate action for like having like porn industry right, can the state carry the burden, which is having in porn industry, and like create like happiness for every people.\n\nWe believe that the answer is no, the most appropriate character, we have to like pursue is to like talk about like those kind of company that have porn industry, how to oppose. For today's debate, like, let me have two arguments. One, why we can provide good environment for having porn industry like privatized. Two, what is going to happen in like our paradigm and in their paradigm having comparison.\n\nSo, like before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear definition and stance for today's debate. Um, so, like, in theirs of the house, they talked about that those radicalization is going to like given in porn industry, and it's going to make like these porn industry, like as a, like coercive situation, but we believe this is not true because in the status quo, we can see like lots of restriction that is given, like, such as like, if there's child like abuse, like child porn, like mostly, there's like such regulation that, like, restricts like child abuse. \n\nAnd moreover, about like those, um, like those, like those, like actress, like care, right? Like theirs of the house, we talked about, like, those company can't care, like to those actress, and there's like such diseases. But we believe in America, like there's lots of investigation that are taking in porn industry, right? Most of the time in America, they have like lots of preparation for those kind of actress. And for those actress, they have lots of,  care, for example, like having pill or having condoms for like those kind of people. And if there's such HIV that are happened,most of the time, those all porn industry, and those kind of company can be stopped, right? \n\n<POI> So who is uniquely the one who investigates and regulates the kind of videos that go out? \n\nWe believe that, one, the regulation are given by the state. But two, the care is going to be like provided by the company. And the company is really proud to stop all industry when such problem is happening, right?\n\nSo moving on to my argument, one, why we can provide good environment for like those privatizing porn industry in the state of court, right? So we believe, um, firstly, let me make a clear analysis of what is porn industry. Two points, right? One, it's about producer, and two about like consumers, right? So, one, let me talk about like those producer, right? Um, like, let me have like, like rebuttal, like concluding in like my argument, right? \n\nSo, in theirs of the house, they talked about that, um, those, um, they talked about like those radicalization will be given, and also like those porn actress will be in like, for example, like, low wage, or in like, coercive environment. But we believe privatization is the most best solution we have to take, right? Because those producer of like those company are the experts, right? They know about like those actress, right? They did like long time like investigation in like those porn, like, um, actress, right? Why? The reason is really simple, right? His experience is like really different, right? Porn industry was given from like several decades, right? Like many decades, and the company knows about those producer, or those actress, that like which, like, um, like which like method is good, or how we can like have like, like those care of like those actress, right? So, the most appropriate, like, um, appropriate actor for like caring like those kind of actress should be like those companies, right?\n\nMoreover, they talked about that, um, radicalization will be given, right? Like, that will be like, connecting to my like, second point, right? Those consumers, right? We believe consumers' needs are the important part, right? We have to talk about and guarantee about like those kind of consumers, right? So, like, if we see like those porn industry, like most of the time, like it's entertainment, right? We have to make happiness in those kind of porn industry, right? It's like same as like, for example, like movies, for example, like animation, right? It's same category that is given in like those kind of things, and we believe consumers' needs are important part, right? So, like, maybe like radicalization will be given, and radicalization will be happening in like those kind of adult videos, or like those kind of things, but we believe those radicalization is just an entertainment, right? We are like keeping on for pushing like those entertainment for like those each individual, right?\n\nSo, moving on to my second point, what is going to happen by like, um, taking, right, like comparing the government side and opposition side, right? We believe government side is like now having a big failure, right? Having a failure, which they're talking about that, um, the country will, or the state will, like, keep having a good, like, environment for like those consumers and for like those actors, right? But we believe this is not true, right? The country is not like experts, right? They don't know about what is happening, or what is the consumer's feelings, or what is the actor's feelings, right? So, they can, like, appropriately, like, make porn interesting in today's society, so our side will provide, like, more, like, like, more, like, suitable way for consumers and for, like, producers, so these are reasons why we're positive."", 2: ""LO claims the government fails to control this kind of porn industry when they themselves literally conceded that it was the government who regulates this industry as well. We simply do not understand why the single-handed most powerful authority of a nation, which is the state, cannot uphold the burden in comparison to a couple of small companies. I'm going to prove to you three things in my speech. First, I'm going to prove to you why, like, according to their, like, um, given the analysis they said, why our side can achieve that much better. Secondly, I'm going to be talking upon, like, their talk about entertainment and why that could be limited. And thirdly, I'm going to be talking to you why our side can uniquely protect the dignity of these actresses.\n\nFirst, a couple of refutations. They said, uh, the LO came up here and said that, uh, that, like, these companies can provide care for actors. We say and we concede that this is true, but this is only true only on a surface level. We think that in cases of big companies, they might have the financial, like, opportunity to look after these actresses. But I, I would argue that these small companies are not equally capable of looking after these kind of actresses. We think in the majority of time in, um, in order to like seek the maximum profit, we think they're more likely to abuse. They're more likely to exploit and go to radical videos like rape, which can gather a lot of money by a lot of extremists. We think upon this, we think that our side, when you nationalize this industry, you're able to provide more care for actors because you ensure that there's going to be a sustainable environment. You ensure that there's not going to be no legal behavior and you allow these actresses always a system to opt out by going to court instead of engaging in potentially illegal behavior by small companies.\n\nSecond rebuttal is upon their point about producers. They said that, uh, these companies have a lot of like experts. First, we don't simply understand why our side can't have producers. We think that our side can unilaterally have a lot of producers and a lot of experts and a lot of health professionals that are hired by the state. We think that's not really important. \n\nBut secondly is I think their side is gonna have the likelihood of having producers who like, who could actually like abuse these actresses based on like holding like access to some of the weaknesses and threatened to exploit their kind of weaknesses and to like lure them into like more extreme behavior. I think that kind of like extreme cases will decrease on our side because you're now going to have producers who are controlled and like made, like, monitored by the single hand, most powerful authority in the nation that therefore we say that our side can provide a safe, better, safer, and a better, more expert controlled kind of environment.\n\nGiven that I'm going to prove to you why entertainment can be limited to some extent. They said that, Hey, you need to care about consumer needs that this porn industry is very likely entertainment. We agree that the porn industry is entertainment, but we disagree upon like the point where we say that in the case where some videos cross the line of like legality, we think that that is extent where the government can intervene. We agree that entertainment is like guaranteed in the case of like soft sex of like just having any kind of sexual intercourse. But we think that there's a clear difference between allowing rape and bestiality and pedophilic videos and, and calling that entertainment. \n\nI think there's two problems. First is that we think that at the borderline where you cross what the like state like allows and organizes, we think that is the extent where it is not entertainment. I think that is like just breaking the law and using it to try to incite the behavior of potential criminals in the future. We think that these kind of videos legitimize these extreme views and we think that is not entertainment. We think that is a form that should be controlled by the government.\n\nGiven that, why does our side save the dignity of women actors? And I'm going to improve the story of why our side is going to just be better or make a better society overall. We think that the porn industry is different from other like industries like movies and theaters because we think that there's a unique difference because we think the sexual images and sexual depiction is, is able to cause and affect attitudes more perniciously. Why is it so? Because we think that the way we view other genders is constructed by the kinds of sexual imagery that is propagated in mass media. That's why in the case of porn, in the porn industry, we think that in order for, in order to generate profit, companies make titles like, hey, for instance, if it's a woman rape, this woman like rolling their eyes, any kind of extreme values that dehumanizes the expression of women.\n\nWe think the privatization, um, we think there's three effects the privatization companies does. First is that this constructs bad norms where women are being treated as a sexual object. We think that LO just said that, hey, we, we regulate this, but we think in the status quo, that's not really true. And we think companies don't have an incentive to control it, anything because that means that's going to mean less profit. \n\nSecondly, is it promotes particular body norms. So then you're going to have like really super attractive blonde, big boob girls. We think that those kinds of stakes are going to be reinforced for the sake of profit. We think that the audience can be like very attracted to those unrealistic behavior. And we think that's going to lead to very unhealthy images.\n\nBut thirdly, as I said earlier, there's no incentive for these private companies to shut out videos. Two reasons. First is because there's a lot of amateur videos, which are unregulated by these companies in the first place. Right. \n\nBut secondly, is that there won't be any kind of profit once you take away these kind of rape or extreme videos. That's literally the reason why these kinds of regulations have failed in the past. \n\nWe think that given these three effects, there's an, we think the privatization does like create a bad thing, which, um, dehumanizes the dignity of women. How do we combat this through nationalization? It's that we say that the porn industry is when you nationalize something, it is the manifestation of the government's thoughts. That's why we think when our side is able to nationalize and prevent any kind of, well, like amateur video to go out, we've confined the imagery to a very restricted and controlled. We think that the States can like enforce regulations and what's acceptable and what's not much better than a, what a small company can do. We think that when you control a certain pool and shut out everything else, there's going to be four, three effects. \n\nFirst, so you can, for instance, it's going to be easier to enforce the uses of condoms and contraception to women. Secondly, is that we can ban child, child, um, child rape scenes, uh, child porn scenes or like rape scenes in general, because I don't think that the government would want those kinds of images to go out. And thirdly, is that you're going to make sure and restrict having kids access to this private companies who really don't really care about kids watching it, because that just means it's going to be more profit given that I think the profit can be mitigated for the sake of protecting, um, these actual workers for this. We think the entertainment can be diminished and we want to combat the truth."", 3: ""Nationalization leads to promotion of foreign industry for citizens. So, is promoting foreign industry for citizens a vote for the government? Our answer is no. Foreign industry is a part of entertainment for some people, but also harmful and should be careful for other people, for example, teenage people. So, there is no necessity in promoting all citizens. And, I move on to report to the government side.\n\nThere is an alternative to ban exceed industry porn industry like movies which contain sex with a child and exceed porn pictures. The government, we think that the government makes laws to ban illegal porn industry. For example, people under 18 or 20 age don't intervene in the porn industry and other sexual industries. And, also set punishment to the company, in case the company forces them to intervene in the porn industry. Then, we can regulate exceed porn industry without nationalizing the porn industry. So, we think that there is no necessity for nationalization.\n\nAnd, which is better for us? Which is better for our society, to nationalize the porn industry or not? If privatization of the porn industry is a part of entertainment, these companies can expand in a country and achieve diversity. And, which is well-known about customers' favorite? We think that company porn industry is better known. So, for that reason, nationalization of the porn industry is not good for the porn industry and our citizens. Thank you."", 4: ""When there's a porn that is nationalized or when there's some porn that is privatized, we believe if we see in those entertainment we believe we can have more entertainment action by privatizing because the privatizing given by those companies knows the most about consumers and they can attract those consumers the most and knows more than those countries. So we are proud to oppose.\n\nLet me have two clash points between today's debate. One will respect the environment of those actresses and people to how entertainment should be in today's society. Before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear rebuttal for individual rebuttal for those previous speakers.\n\nTheir argument was like they said that first it's really difficult for it to completely ban and radicalization will be given in today's society. But we believe this is not true because, as we insisted in those POI and as we insisted in constructive arguments, we said that those regulations will make those radical scenes like ban and we believe those in this society like those scenes are now not given, right? \n\nMoreover, what the second speaker talked about was that norms will be given and those women's dignity will be taken in those societies. But this is not true because most of those radicalized, for example, those rape porn, it's mostly people know about it's entertainment, people know that it's just entertainment and not like real radicalization or real rape. We believe every people know about that, and we believe this is not a big issue we have to talk about in today's debate.\n\nMoving on to my clash points, one which will respect these actresses. Government side talked about it will just have a really bad environment for those kinds of people and actress care will collapse. But we believe this is not true. Opposition side will clearly claim that the most quickly that can move is those private companies, right? The quickness is really different. Companies can really quickly move for moving for those actresses, and when those problems will be provided, they can have a solution, right? Moreover, the point we wanted to push is those actress care. Actress care is not about those HIV or those kinds of diseases. We believe mental care should be the most priority. In our side of the house, we can accomplish that.\n\nSo, the last point, the last clash, how entertainment should be. Government will restrict radical scenes, they'll restrict every scene, and the country will control that. But compared to opposition, we will restrict just minimum restriction. We will make a regulation. What we want to push is those entertainment, the company mostly knows about those consumers, right? We believe those porn industry should be shown as entertainment, and humans should be looking at those porn industry as entertainment and fun. For these reasons, we are proud to oppose."", 5: ""Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. The question of this debate, we clarify the question of this debate. Oppositional side said, A, they strongly regulate the content and B, they invest in the porn industry from the government. But if so, what is the exclusivity compared to the government bench? Because even without regulation, even without investigation, also the government can make this content in the first place. And if they strongly regulate, also they don't achieve their goal. Because they are very limited of the diversity in the first place. That's why their argumentation is false. The key, the opposition argument is said.\n\nSo, given that, what is the sole plus point in this debate? Firstly, which side is the larger possibility to decrease the abusement of the porn industry? And secondly, whether we need to satisfy the many consumers by this diversity content? \n\nSo firstly, which side has the larger possibility to decrease the abusement? They said regulation is enough. But we told you three things. Firstly, the state can't always supervise each corporation. Because there are many members of the corporation and this content itself, making content itself is very black box. And the state can't supervise. \n\nAnd secondly, B, the diplomats already said, this borderline illegal content and immoral content is very, very vague. That's why it's very difficult to limit preemptively. Once it was made, the Prime Minister already told you that. This video is very easily spread. \n\nAnd it's also, this content dehumanized the female. And it's directly make the bad harm into the society. That's the reason why this preemptive measure is very important. That exclusivity is only remain from the government.\n\nAnd secondly, so they said, entertainment is not always guaranteed by the private corporation. But we told you that this entertainment is not so important compared to the harm. That argument is, I'm saying from the second point. So whether we need to satisfy the many consumers. So they are afraid of the decline of the entertainment of the quality. Because they say, this corporation always hire this professional producer. But the Prime Minister already said that. Also, it's not a mutual exclusion. Because states also have, also hire this professional producer under the status of supervision. This only excluded is the risk of this bad content in the past years. That's why, as long as this professional producer exists inside. This is not so mutual exclusive. And it doesn't mean, it means this opposition's argument is not stand in the first place.\n\nSo secondly, we already did the comparison of the diversity of the entertainment and the safety of the society. Opposition side always prioritizes the diversity of the entertainment to satisfy the many numbers of the people. But we already told you that. This satisfaction is not important compared to the increasing of the victim. Because if once this video is spread, and many numbers of the violent action also possibly occur. For example, the mimic of the violent content such as the rape, and such a beast, and the upload of poltergeist. So that kind of the violent action is also comparatively occur to the opposition's bench. That's the reason why, if as long as the victim is not saved by the opposition's bench. We don't prioritize this diversity of the entertainment. For those reasons, we proudly propose the motion.""}"
17,【確かに戦隊モノって女性ヒーローいないよに】mixidea高校定期練習,THBT we should include a female character in a hero program as a leader.,"{0: 'Just like the word ""her"" is in the word ""hero,"" we think that females are also capable of being heroes just similar to male figures like Captain America or any kind of Go Rangers. We think that there\'s a current notion in which female characters are thought to be incapable, that they have to follow romantic pursuits with the hot, sexy main character. We think that these kind of notions are unhealthy for the people in the audience that are watching it, and especially the children. I\'m very happy to propose. \n\nI\'m going to be setting up the motion before I begin. On our side, we don\'t think that all female characters should always be the leader. What we support as proposition is a healthy mixture of decent female leaders as also male leaders. We think that we want to pursue and promote the idea of females being capable of being a leader as much as males, and we think that this is a brilliant idea in reducing discrimination.\n\nSecondly, is that we think this is going to be an effective motion in dealing with gender injustices. Given that we cannot prove, even if we cannot prove, that there\'s going to be certain changes in real life, we think that our side, this debate should be measured on equity, that is the principle of whether we should pursue relative equality in the terms of including female characters. \n\nGiven this, I\'m going to give you two arguments. First, why this is a necessary motion for the state to take. Secondly, and on our side, why this is going to be the most effective motion in dealing with gender injustices. Let\'s talk about why this is a necessary motion.\n\nTwo things. First, is that we think that the concept of leaders is not something that is dependent on gender. Just like in real life, how there are many female leaders as well as male leaders, we think that even in Marvel or any kind of film industry, we think that female characters are also capable of being leaders. We think there needs to be a strong image, especially in the media, where everyone is directly influenced by every single day, that there needs to be a strong message that women are also capable. That the fact that they are being leaders and being in control of certain groups does not necessarily mean that we think that if they are being able to be a strong leader in a field, we think that is able to promote a bigger message in real life in promoting gender justice. And I\'ll be talking about this later.\n\nBut secondly, we think this is just for the state to take because we think that these kind of medias are going to be like the manifestation of a state\'s standards. So what I mean by this is that we think that when media influence is very strong, we think that there\'s a strong and moral obligation for the state to ensure moral equality. And we think this is seen in the cases of a lot of movies where there are certain like female heroes such as Wonder Woman or any those kind of instances. And we think that the state should actively promote any kind of gender equality. And we think this side is just in including female characters by the simple fact that there are female characters that are excluded from being leaders just on the basis of their gender. Given this, we think this is a necessary motion given the benefits. There\'s going to be female actors. And we think this is my second argument. I\'ll be talking about this.\n\n<POI> What do you think about the difference between the hero program given in man or the pretty cute hero program? What is the difference?\n\nI\'ll talk about that later when I give my characterization. So I recommend you wait for a couple of minutes.\n\nSo second argument, why this is the most effective motion dealing with gender injustices. What we think, before I begin my substantive, I\'m going to be explaining and contextualizing what female characters are currently like.\n\nThree things. First is that we think that females are almost never a central character. That is, the women do not currently have basically any kind of female role model to look forward to. We think that, sure, there might be some central characters. But the problem is that we think we need more female characters in the pursuit of leadership. Because we think that these few examples are likely to be sexualized just because of the fact that producers have to choose always the most sexiest and hottest woman. And we think that tends to get sexualized. We don\'t think that the sexualization of women leaders is necessarily a good thing. We think that on our side, when we include more female actors and make sure there are more central characters, we think that you don\'t really need to rely on this facial benefit. And rather, you could rather pursue the true message of the movie. That is, to pursue females as a leader.\n\nBut secondly, so we think there\'s a lot of maternal and romantic links. That is that in movies like The Independence Day, there\'s a lot of women who end up falling in love with the main character, the very hot white guy, right? And we think that this promotes the message of women being told to be independent. We don\'t think that\'s necessarily a good thing. \n\nBut C is that female characters currently have to be rescued. This is seen in a lot of princess movies where women are taught and promoting the message that they have to currently be dependent on the main buff hero. And we think this emphasizes the masculinity of males. And we think this isn\'t necessarily a good thing.\n\nSo how does this change under our world? Two things. First, is that these leaders are going to become a central figure, right? We think that\'s going to mean you\'re going to have closer proximity to males and females. And we think that female leaders are capable as similar to male leaders. \n\nBut B is that these female characters as a leader are going to have more power. We think this is going to promote the message that women are also capable of resolving conflicts, that they are also capable of negotiating certain conflicts to negotiate this in a peaceful manner. \n\nNow, to answer the POI of opposition, that is the difference between male leaders and female leaders, we say there is no difference. That is, the females are also as enough capable as the males. And we think this is a necessary policy because currently there\'s a status quo which stigmatizes against female characters as leaders. This is because of the unconceived notion that like just the patriarchal society deems females as more incapable than males. And we think this isn\'t untrue, right? We think that female characters are also capable. So we see that there\'s no difference at all, that they are both capable and we think we should remove that kind of stigmatization.\n\nSo what happens once we have these kind of powerful central figured characters is that children who are easily influenced by the media just by the fact that they don\'t have any kind of like preconceived ideas are going to now look at this and we think that female children are now going to have a more active and positive role model of a leader. So in the future, we think they\'re less likely to feel like females are unable to do anything. We think that rather they\'re going to have the feeling that they can be a leader, that they can strive to be a female CEO. So even in the real life, we think that the sense message of female leadership is going to be promoted and we think this is something we always ought to pursue. I\'m very happy.', 1: ""So, we have three points. First, about how women can be seen as having roles for unsuccessful people. And about the impact, and the second about the impact on children. And the third about violence.\n\nSo first, I'd like to move on to the first point about leaders. This motion says that the female character in hero programs as a leader, and as a leader, women can be portrayed as also unsuccessful people. And in this reality where men tend to be leaders. This motion won't necessarily make women successful leaders, which are actually morally correct.\n\nAnd so we're moving on to the second point. I think we can all agree that when children watch hero programs, they are inspired by the characters' actions, and therefore they will start acting like them. And for example, for girls, there are hero programs for girls like PQR, and for boys, there are hero programs such as Coming Data. And if girls start being the main leader in programs like Coming Data, even the boys mostly watch. There is a possibility that boys will feel reluctant to act like leaders, and that is the complete opposite of what we are actually trying to do. But this motion may not be able to inspire boys to become leaders.\n\nAnd moving on to the third point. We think that, in a way, the government supporting hero programs can be seen as supporting violence. If you look at classic hero programs like Marvel movies. It is pretty clear that the characters are using violence in order to solve their problems. However, removing an insane amount of these programs is not realistic because they are some of the biggest industries in the world. This is why instead of including female characters in hero programs, we should keep supporting feminism like we have in the past.\n\nNow I'd like to move on to my rebuttals. The government side said that in hero movies, women tend to fall in love. And this is not telling girls to be independent. And yeah, but just because girls become. Just because women fall in love with a hot guy, for example, that doesn't mean that they won't be willing to become leaders. \n\nAnd the government also said that women are this. But that doesn't necessarily mean this motion doesn't necessarily lead to telling people that women are capable. Not including female characters in hero programs can be seen as a message that women are incapable of resolving conflict. But that doesn't necessarily mean this motion doesn't necessarily lead to telling people that women are capable of being independent and resolving conflict.\n\nIn summary, women can be seen as having roles for unsuccessful characters because of the norm that we have right now. This motion can lead to women being portrayed as unsuccessful characters and that children might receive the wrong message, such as they might feel reluctant to become leaders, which is the opposite of the message we're trying to send out. And supporting current hero programs is not something the government should do because, in a way, it's supporting violence. Thank you."", 2: ""First of all, I would like to rebut to what opposition has said. First speaker said three things. First of all, about unsuccessful people. But even if female leaders become unsuccessful people, in the world, there are many, many movies of hero programs where the male is the leader. So, it means that there also have unsuccessful people, not only female but also male.\n\nSecond, they have said that children are part of the hero program. For example, Kamen Rider is a hero program that boys also watch. But we already defined that we can make not only a female leader but also a male leader, right? So, we don't say that Kamen Rider's leader is female. But that program can continue with a male becoming a leader. \n\nAnd third, they talk about violence. So, violence shows how strong they are. Even if the woman becomes a leader, they can show strength to the people who are watching. And I'm gonna explain later, too. And also, even if they use violence, it means that males also use violence, right? So, they explain that males can use violence, but women can't use that, right? \n\nSo, I'm gonna talk about reconstruction. First, we think that, for example, Marvel or Kamen Rider has a female hero, right? For a supporting role. But why is it important to become a leader? By making a female a leader, it will be a model for everyone that females also can become a leader in society, right? Because now in the world, there are many leaders that are male or some male and fewer leaders that are female. \n\nAnd if we take this notion, we can have a good effect for children in society. First of all, about children. As the first speaker has said, they have a good effect on children because children always watch hero programs. And it will affect people. For example, Kamen Rider, children watch every Sunday morning, right? And children watch for the long term. So, we feel that it is general that females will become a leader, right? So, children can have less of an image of a gender gap. Even if they get older, they have no feeling of having a gender gap. \n\nAnd also, why this is good for society? If the female character becomes a leader in a hero program, it will be the movement that females become a leader in society, right? Because hero programs are watched not only by children but also by adults, right? Like Marvel or something like that is also popular among adults, right? So, this is a good effect for society. \n\nAnd they have said about violence. So, I would like to explain more. So, most hero programs like Kamen Rider or some other hero programs have a person affected by evil, right? So, this person is mostly girls or people who have a weak situation, right? But this is not equal, right? So, by women becoming a leader and so strong, it will remove the image that girls are weak and males are strong, right? For these reasons, we would like to proudly support this motion. Thank you."", 3: ""We believe Hero Program is for those people who are children, right? Hero Program can make children inspired and shape their identity and thoughts in childhood, right? So if we have an issue or problem that is given in, for example, gender discrimination or another problem, if we can make that, we believe both children's dreams will be crushed and we believe that as a result, those societies will be counterproductive for those females, right? So we're proud to oppose.\n\nToday's debate, let me have two arguments. One, why will this motion make females counterproductive? Two, let me compare the paradigm between the government and opposition, right?\n\nSo firstly, let me make a rebuttal of what the previous speaker was talking about. So the government's main case was solving the discrimination of those people by having a leader, right? But as my first speaker was talking about, my first speaker clearly talked about that these data schools are providing female characters, for example, Marvel. \n\nMoreover, my first speaker talked about that those female romantic loves won't be solved by those leaders, by providing leaders, right? The reason was, I think that romantic things are not just because of not having leaders, but this is because of a general narrative, right? Even though if we take this situation, those romantic scenes won't be taken, right? Those romantic scenes will be remade, and we believe this motion is inappropriate, right? \n\nMoreover, what they talked about was that they said that children won't change their images, and it will influence better to the society, but our side completely talked about that this certain image will make females counterproductive, and we believe this is unjustifiable, right?\n\nSo moving on to my argument, one, why will this motion make counterproductive for those females, right? So let me make a clear analysis of what is HERO. Two points. One, HERO makes a dream for every child, and it's a certain definition called inspiration for children. Two, it will make strong messages for every people, and for, no, it will make strong messages for the people in today's society, right? So the reason why it will make a dream for those children is that children see those HERO programs for a long time, right? In childhood, children see those HERO programs on the screen, and they have a dream that they want to be a HERO, right? So every people have an experience for having a dream that they want to be a HERO and seeing those HERO programs, right? \n\nAnd second, it will make a strong message in today's society. But today's debate is like a thing we have to talk about, that there's like two messages, right? There's two messages. One, it's for like boys' messages, and two, there's a message for like those girls, right? So mainly, let's just talk about messages of like girls and boys. We believe like those kind of HERO programs are not just particularly for like boys and particularly for like those girls, right? Like we believe there's like a lot of HERO programs, such as Pretty Cura, right? If we see Pretty Cura, most of the time, like those kinds of girls are going to be the leader, right? What we want to say is that like if we see HERO programs, it's like mainly for action for like those boys, right? Boys mainly see HERO programs, and they'll be attracted, right? Pretty Cura is for like girls, so that's why leaders are given.\n\nSo what we want to say is that as if we make female character as a leader in HERO programs, it will hinder like boys' dreams, right? It will hinder boys' like narrative, and we can make like those kind of female, we can crush like those kind of children's dream, right? So like those messages are really strong, and as we make female leaders, what will happen is that as my first speaker said, those kinds of females will be in like an unsuccessful situation, or they'll be like in a situation that they'll be criticized by like those society, right? So as a conclusion for my first argument, when like those kind of female leaders are included, they'll be in a bad circumstance.\n\nAnd moreover, like we believe that those particular differences between like those boys' HERO program and girls' HERO program, we believe we can't like include like certain gender and push certain gender, and as an extent, like those kind of gender problem is like made by adults, right?\n\nI'll talk about like more specifically in my second argument. My second argument, it's like comparative between the government side and opposition side. The government side is trying to solve gender discrimination, and they're trying to mitigate those kind of romantic scenes. But opposition side are respecting each character, and respecting the dreams of those children. \n\nSo what we want to say is that those kind of leader making HERO program as a leader of female, it's just like a problem that is given by adults, right? It's an adult problem we have to talk about, and it's not like children to be like solving, right? So as we like give like those kind of problem from adults, as if we make that, it will just hinder the dreams of children, and hindering like those dreams of the boys as we hear like those HERO program. These are reasons why we're part of the vote."", 4: 'Okay, thank you, speakers. So we are seeing that the women are so marginalized that, you know, the society pushes the message that women should be the more housewife, becoming the other women, not becoming the leadership, and so forth. \n\nBut we believe that because the society requires women to become more such things, so used to be the make a boyfriend and romantic love, that this kind of social pressure is making a woman more so unfair, and it\'s not good. So we believe that this kind of disproportionate unhealthy situation is so harmful, so there is no justification on this paradigm. Therefore, we are going to propose our case here.\n\nSo basically, I\'m going to talk about three things. Firstly, engage with the opposition\'s cases. So what is the hero story, and the kinder or the boy\'s dream or not? Secondly, the principle level, whether it is justified, this social structure, the pushing the burden for the women and the girls. Thirdly, the practical change, how the effect is going on.\n\nSo let\'s engage with the first cross point, whether or not what is the hero story, and the boy\'s dream is going to be right or not. So basically, opposition side is saying that, what is the hero, it\'s a boy\'s dream. So the question is that, whether we don\'t think that they are fitting the motions, or KCPM have said on this debate is. So basically, we are not going to prohibit those kinds of movies, like it\'s balanced. If you want to see the Kamen Rider, who the main character is leaders, then you can watch. And if you want to watch the program, the leader is women, then you can watch it. So this kind of choice is shared. \n\nSo we believe that on our side, some people, some girls who want to watch the movies, cannot consume those ideas at all. So they feel happy and they cannot become good. So in that sense, we are saying that, still, even on our paradigm, those boys can have a dream, and they can enjoy and consume those kinds of content, so they can be happy. So it doesn\'t fit it. So we don\'t destroy the dream of those people, boys.\n\nSecondly, they are also saying that women should enjoy the ""Pri-kyua"" or romantic love. That is unrealistic. Basically, the first point is that, who decides, who can determine that women should, making a boyfriend or a husband, or supporting someone, partner, is very important things. So this kind of social pressure is unjustifiable because those girls cannot agree on, or consensus for this issue. So having this kind of pressure that woman must like to support a man, such mindset or stereotype itself is problematic. \n\nTherefore, we are going to increase the, yes, you know, program, which can, the women are taking a leadership, like man or masculinity. This kind of characteristic is required. Therefore, we are proposing.\n\nThirdly, the pre-cure cases, they are saying that pre-cure, those girls can be happy, but that\'s also unrealistic. Simply because the pre-cure is only women\'s group. The member of the group is only women and girls. So in that sense that, they are regarded as only in the women\'s communities, that the leader is working. But if there were a man, maybe she is a supporter. Those kinds of things, is going to be regarded and perceived. \n\nIn that sense, that\'s not helpful or useful for those girls who want to become a leader, are not encouraged or inspired at all. So therefore, that\'s not enough. Therefore, we are saying that our case is important. Basically, that\'s not basically, we are saying that it\'s not mutually exclusive. So if you want to support those people, yes, let\'s support it. Even on our paradigm, there are those characteristics opposition side is saying, it\'s supported. So that\'s not the important thing. So therefore, the opposition case is not making sense.\n\nLastly, even if all my analysis was false, but still the social structure or mindset, or social recognition can be changed. So in the status quo, yes, what we have said might be true. The women are regarded as, yes, you know, backfire might be because, but that\'s just only short term. In the middle term and long term, the social recognition for the feminist movement or other kind of people, about these kinds of actions, in that sense, we do not assume that it\'s not harmful. So therefore, the logic doesn\'t stand.\n\nOkay, let\'s move on to the next first point. Whether or not it is justified in the principle level? Can our paradigm be justified or not? So we are saying that as a leader, those program is justified or not. We say that basically the opposition side thinks that the hero should be the leader as a man, but that\'s nonsense because simply, the biological relationship already can\'t be clarified. There\'s no connection. Just because you are a woman, you are incapable of taking a leadership. So there\'s no scientific proof or evidence on this matter. So we believe that this artificial and arbitrary structure is so problematic. \n\nSo we believe that this kind of the norm or stigmatization makes the woman weaker and weaker, and those girls internalize the ideas, I cannot do anything, or I am incapable, I am useless. So I just support that someone. So this kind of thinking is so harmful. So regardless of the fact they have an ability, they can do that, but they cannot do that because society expects the woman to not do so that. So this is harmful. \n\nSo as a result, what will happen is that those kind of the stigmatization, it\'s become less and those women still can become accept the realization more equally and fairly. So as a result, overall, what is more justifiable framework is our side. So that compared to the harm, our benefit is far more better. We are happy to propose.', 5: 'We think that this is not a simple question that if we like include female characters and hero programs as leader all kind of like female and female problems are going to be solved and female leaders can advance in society. We don\'t think that these kind of studies are not being made because now in America or like in other places like Ghostbusters or like other things included these female characters in their ones. However, nothing is going to change; rather, it\'s going to harm these situations. We like talking our point, but we say these situations will never be solved but in their paradigm but it is going to cause more harm to these people. That\'s actually why we\'re going to say that it is very harmful for us.\n\nOkay, moving back. Okay, we like talk about several things, but before that, I\'d like to rebut to their points. Well, firstly they say that like these kind of like gender gaps it\'s going to the gender gap of these children is going to decline. But firstly, alright, um I don\'t think that these kind of like gender gap is going to decline only by seeing these hero programs because we have like a lot of things and a lot of things that you can see. \n\nBut even if we take their best-case scenario we think that when you try to become adult you gradually realize the male dominance and will and will still be brainwashed by the society right. Because even now even in America if you see like the female Ghostbusters because society is still being the kind of like male-dominant society nothing\'s going to change; rather, these children are going to be stigmatized again, stigmatized as ""oh women cannot move"" even in their cases.\n\nSecondly, they say always like falling in love is like being independent or like rescue; it\'s being independent. It\'s something like romantic things are a social pressure but firstly, um we don\'t we don\'t think that these kinds of things it\'s like dependent or like independent well not always the red people is going to help the yellow or the pink person um the yellow and the pink person sometimes help like the blue person or the red person or like that kind of things too and we think that these things is very justifiable that these women are actually independent in the first place. \n\nBut secondly, we say that this is not a social pressure too even that we say that some, for example, we have some kind of counterexample. For example, Wonder Woman. In these cases, a person is actually going to fall in love with a female leader or like other things too. So even we say, even we say that these kinds of things are a social pressure, we don\'t think that these things are going to change the society in their paradigm. We don\'t think that these things are very effective for it.\n\nMoreover, okay, and certainly, they always say that they have the ability, so why don\'t you include these kinds of female characters and hero programs? I know that maybe in some cases you have a decent like female people can actually have these kinds of powers. However, we don\'t think that because you have power, if you become a leader, nothing is like all things are going to change. But rather, we say these people are going to be exploited.\n\nWhat we want to say is that we don\'t want to make it down to the bottom in the slide. Don\'t think that only including females in the hero programs as leaders can change the whole society. Even Ghostbusters and other shows included female leaders, male leaders are still dominant. And since it\'s still a male-dominant society, even females try to develop in the studies, you\'re going to be exploited as Janna Daruku, who was made as a leader and tried her best but betrayed and cut off from the other males, just as Japanese scientist Obokata Haruko, male exploits the female dreams. And actually, we say that we don\'t want to think that we should like produce these kinds of male-like female fatalities in these studies. So we think that is very harmful.\n\nIf you\'re going to make these kinds of social norms that females are good and can advance in society, we actually oppose these things because we say that the females are going to be exploited. We don\'t want to make it too, right? And it\'s not about these kinds of abilities; it is about your status of it. But if we can\'t change society and or like others, we sometimes need to do. We\'ll talk later, okay?\n\nAll right, so I\'d like to go to the comparison, firstly about the boy\'s dreams. They mostly didn\'t talk about it; well, they sometimes talk about it, but what we say on our side is that the boy streams are going to be deprived. Why is it so? Because we say that if you\'re going to show up some kind of female leaders or other things, some are going to think, ""Oh, my dream is going to be deprived."" If you think that the females are going to be in there, the boys will be discouraged in their dreams to become a leader. We say that this is going to happen in their paradigm, and we say that because of this, the boys are going to be shrinking in the body.\n\nHowever, what\'s going to happen to these females if you\'re going to have some, even if you don\'t have these kinds of female characters as a hero? You will still think that these kinds of females are still going to develop in the bodies if they really want to do. For example, if some people, if some kind of person, like, for example, the Avengers or other things, if you\'re going to say that these people are actually having some kind of member of the females, you still know these females have the power and have enough ability to be independent, to be or fight as one of the people is as a hero member or like that. We think that this is very good because we say that these individuals are going to be evaluated in these kinds of things. \n\nWe think that the stigmatization or other things are going to change more, and it\'s going to change the future. Maybe it\'s so, but in the long term, we think that these things are going to change in the future. We don\'t think that we don\'t, and okay, what we want to say in our speech is that we don\'t want to exploit those women. But if we want to think in the long term, with these kinds of women can develop in the future, that\'s actually why we strongly oppose.', 6: ""Okay, so all through this debate, the government side has been imposing itself to the light burden of proof. So their stance went like this. They said, so the pressure to conform to gender identity image is so unjustifiable, and they said they have a moral obligation to try to solve those unjustifiable situations. \n\nSo the prime minister told you that even if their plan is not going to work, they have an obligation to try. So they try to, so they ignore the inefficiency of the plan by using the word moral obligation, but they must not run away with such a light burden because when the government restrict something, restrict freedom of speech, it is when those restrictions or something or rule is 100% effective. For example, there is a right of reply on media, right? When media discriminated against the minority, the minority has the right to, like, say no on the same media, and that is effective, 100% effective, because it causes discourse.\n\nBut in this case, the government failed to prove that their plan is 100% effective. So their plan is so nonsense. Like, it's like putting a straw in the river to change the flow of the water, right? And that straw can trap fishes inside the river. So it has risk. So what they have to prove is those straw is strong enough, 100%, to change the river. So we told you how this motion has a risk to harm children's being or harm the situation of gender inequality.\n\nSo having solved principal classes, we're moving on to the practical things, which is two questions. So firstly, whether the status quo is good enough or not. So secondly, whether including one figure in a movie will make the status quo more better. As for the first questions, our speaker effectively told you how role models already exist in the real world. So, but we have been saying this from a member of the opposition, but the other side didn't engage in our claim that there exist role models in the real world.\n\nThe other side just concentrated on the woman speaker in, like, hero programs. But this is nonsense because this debate is actually is about how women representation in the real world is going to change. So it's nonsense to just concentrate on the role inside a program and don't see the real effect on the real world. So we can clearly say that the status quo is good enough because the role models that the government has been defending already exist in the real world.\n\nSo moving on to the second practical question, so does taking this motion make the status quo better or not? You say no. So there are two patterns of female leaders in hero programs, right? So LO tells you the cases in which women are being assigned unsuccessful roles. So there is, so this is likely, as we proved, because the people are seeking for male leaders. \n\nAnd another case when women become sidekick leaders and males become, women become actual leaders, we already told you this harms the boy's dream, right? So in both cases, it will be harm.\n\nAnd so they, our only response was, oh, in the long term, this is good. But again, this is nonsense because does a straw in a river will change the flow of the water in the long run? Absolutely not. They are saying that there exist many female sexualized characters in the movie, and they're introducing only one woman. And we don't think this would change the situation. Therefore, we are proud to propose."", 7: ""This motion is effective for both girls and boys. First, I'm going to talk about its effectiveness for girls. If we take this motion, paper problems that include a female leader influence girls, showing them that women can be a leader in the future. Taking this motion, girls can have new dreams to become leaders, influencing their aspirations positively.\n\nHowever, the opposition side argued that it is effective for boys. By taking this motion, boys' dreams can also be influenced, crashing boys' dreams, but in this motion, not all TV programs have to change to include a female leader.\n\nThe opposition claims that the percentage of male first-place winners in competitions is larger than the female population in the country now. While it is true that more males can become leaders, taking this motion doesn't crush the dream of being a leader for boys in the future. For these reasons, the effect for girls is more substantial by taking this motion.\n\nNow, moving on to the second point: why is this effective for society? Because people's problems are the only TV programs that children want to watch. Children don't want to watch news or documentaries about social problems because they can't understand enough about these issues. Thus, a program with a female leader has the most significant influence to tell children that women can be leaders, promoting more males to be leaders in the future. This can reduce gender discrimination.\n\nThe opposition side raised concerns about potential violence in these programs, but violence is not an explanation that we brought up in our rebuttal. Instead, we argue that this can make males strong leaders in society to solve problems. We believe that taking this motion has a positive effect on society. Thank you.""}"
18,銀杏杯 2016 Oct. Gov.NitA Opp.KDS,THW criminalize the payment of ransom to terrorist groups,"{0: ""Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen in this house. Our side believes that we want to protect most moral people, every people, so every innocent people. And now another thing that's called the technology of hacking system or security camera is developing now and police can capture surprise information in the group of terrorists. So, thanks to those things, we can search those terrorists' move and act. \n\nAnd the payment of ransom is money source of terrorist and criminal group. Huge rate of money source is ransom. Plus, criminal is very malicious. So, in many cases, even if victim's side pays huge money to the terrorist group and criminal groups, the victim will be killed by them. This is a very major case, but the family wants to protect their own family or own child, so they give money.\n\nOkay, let's move on to my argument. I have two arguments in this round. Firstly, I'd like to talk about long-term benefits, capturing those terrorists' source of money. And secondly, to save all people and victims, this plan is a very efficient way. \n\nBefore, I want to define this motion. This house means all liberal democratic country. And when a criminal requests ransom from individual victims, family, or government or bank, in all situations, we criminalize the payment of ransom.\n\nOkay, let's move on to my argument. Firstly, I'd like to talk about the long-term benefits. Under the status quo, family strongly love the child or they have a very great memory from the child, so they strongly want to save, right? So, suddenly, they give money to terrorist groups. They are very confused about the situation; it's a crazy situation. So, they easily do without concern with police or specialists, so they cannot judge this system objectively. \n\nSo, in the rare case, they are very rich, so they can give the money. Another rare case, they are poor, they rent from the black market or something, not so good source of the money, comes to the poor family's house, and this money goes to the terrorist groups. So, terrorists get a huge source of money. \n\nWhy is it so big harm? Because if the terrorists have huge money, they can buy more weapons, such as guns and more harmful drugs or something, so they can expand power easily if they have more money. So, worse accidents will occur due to the money. So, we want to stop this source.\n\nAfter taking this plan, we criminalize this payment of ransom. So, reduce payment. Many people don't want to criminalize the ransom, so they can see this situation more objectively, and this is criminalized. So, if I give the money, it is criminalized, so we should consult with specialists or police. \n\nSo, in that case, police can effectively solve the situation because they have the technology, as I mentioned in the introduction, hacking or searching through the security camera, we can effectively search the terrorists and arrest them. So, in this case, we believe that long term, we can arrest the terrorists and save more, not expand the harm for another people and worse case.\n\nAnd secondly, I would like to explain why this plan can effectively save more people than now. So, as I mentioned in the introduction, even just paying of ransom to terrorist groups, this money, in the end, the terrorist is very malicious, so they kill or request more money. So, this request is not cut by only one request of ransom, so this ransom cannot save the victims, surely. \n\nAnd also, as I mentioned again and again, this money is very harmful to society because worse accidents occur and also the individual family and victims cannot save thanks to ransom. So, we strongly believe that ransom is meaningless for saving the individual victims and also it is very harmful for the society. In this viewpoint, we strongly propose this motion and I am happy to propose. Thank you."", 1: ""Ladies and gentlemen, what the government says is that the reason why we have to prosecute the terrorists is that because they killed the citizens. They murdered the citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, we think that because we know that in order not to concede the terrorists, they are going to sacrifice the citizens. We believe that it is not very counterproductive if the fundamental purpose was against terrorism. \n\nSo, before landing on my argumentation, I have to talk about something about the science department.\n\nFirstly, we have to confirm that the resource for the terrorists does not necessarily come from the nation itself. Ladies and gentlemen, for example, the income of the ISIS does not come from the oil field they took or the donation from some assistance to these kinds of terrorist groups. We think that in those cases, it is very unclear from the government's argumentation how to what extent the existence of ransom is going to contribute to the genocide of the terrorist groups. However, we think that in those cases, in this debate, we think that because the ransom itself does not so contribute to the empowerment of the terrorists, we don't think it is a good proposal.\n\nSo, about the model of the government side, the government side has said that they are going to let the police to censor the citizens. We think it is not realistic. Under their model, they are going to let the police to write a statement. We think it is not something justifiable, even if it can contribute to the vanishment of the terrorists. And also, we think that because even if the government does state that its citizens not to go to the terrorist group, we think that as long as the government can't fulfill their duty to protect the citizens, that means the government should not respect individuals to save the others or to save the citizens.\n\nSo, moving on to the government or the opposition side. About the model of the opposition side, we have to go by four. First, we are going to take the countermeasure against the terrorists. That is to say, after helping the hostages, we are going to do the air strike and so on.\n\nSecondly, as I said, the income of the terrorists comes from not only the ransom, but rather comes from the other resources such as the oil fields, such as QSOS, ISIS, and so on. We see that we don't necessarily pay the ransom in the first place.\n\nThird, we are going to give the choice for citizens whether or not they are going to pay the ransom or not. We require citizens to compare the risk that it is beneficial for themselves to save the hostages and so on. \n\nAnd also, fourth, in the paradigm, we are going to require every state to intervene in the negotiation of terrorists in order to moderate the amount of ransom that the citizens are going to pay for saving the hostages and so on.\n\nSo, fundamentally, we think that because there are some factors, the inevitable kidnapper is one of those. This is my first idea. We think that fundamentally, in the case of the spy or the social, that is, government, that is sent to the territory of terrorists, we think that they are not responsible for their own fault. That is to say, they kidnap them. We think that because the government forced these kind of people to go to the terrorist's territory, and as a consequence, they are going to be arrested by terrorists. In that case, you have to immobilize the government and make them fully responsible for saving these kind of people because we think that the government let them to go to the very dangerous area, and as a consequence, they are going to pay for their safety. We think that in that case, the government shouldn't anyway to deny the payment for ransom. \n\nAnd also, we think that payment for ransom is the most effective way to save these kind of hostages because we think that if terrorists does not release these kind of hostages, that means that terrorists are going to express in public that if we are going to get the ransom, we are not going to release, we are not going to return those hostages. So if they say that the terrorist group is going to be incentivized by the public to pay ransom, so in that case, the case is a complete counter-vote for the terrorist group. Therefore, we think that if they pay the ransom, the terrorist group has an incentive to return these kind of hostages. \n\nAnd also, even if they stop the payment for ransom, the kidnapping does not stop because we think that the purpose of kidnapping does not necessarily come from the income of the ransom, ladies and gentlemen. For example, ISIS kidnapped the Syrians in order for their local government in order to fear the public and also it can be beneficial for itself. And also, in those cases, the purpose of kidnapping does not necessarily come from the ransom itself. Therefore, we think that because sometimes the government is fully responsible for the payment of ransom and also there is an inevitable case of kidnapping and also even after the kidnapping, the oppressor will not protect or prevent the kidnapping to be possible for the oppressor.\n\nAnd also, in addition to that, we have to recognize that even if people fully take care about and fully pay attention, they sometimes will be caught by terrorism. For example, even if you are outside of the terrorist territory, in any state that's caught, for example, the member of ISIS is going to cause you beyond the border of the country and also as a consequence, even if you pay full attention for that, you are going to be arrested by terrorism. That is to say, we need to ensure that each citizen can protect themselves. \n\nAnd also, why do we need to ensure the right to help others? We think that the reason why we allow the citizens as a self-defense to kill other people is that because the government does not have the total self-duty to protect its citizens, citizens do not have any way to protect themselves by themselves. We think that in this case, it can be applicable because we think that the government fails to stop the citizens to go to these kinds of dangerous areas or from being captured by terrorism. We think that in that case, because citizens have no way to protect themselves, and also, government cannot fulfill these kinds of rights and these kinds of duties, in that case, obviously, government should ensure that they help themselves.\n\nAnd also, in addition to that, the biggest problem of this government side is that why they can justify to criminalize the act to save these kinds of citizens? Because we think that this is completely against the purpose of against terrorism."", 2: ""Under the status quo, there are many incidents that are by terrorists. Many people are killed in airports or by Islamic State or ISIS. Many victims are existing and the victims' families suffer from the blacking of the family. They are killed by the terrorist, the service terrorists. So, we have to stop the situation. But after taking a bath, under the status quo, there are no solutions to stop. Uniquely, there is a high possibility to save the innocent citizens. So, we cannot stop the terrorists from killing people.\n\nAfter taking this plan, we can minimize the situation because the almost payment of the terrorists is non-sum now. Many money is contributed to the terrorists by the citizens or government. Also, the individual issue. This is selfish and this makes the more serious situation around the world. So, we have to propose this proposal. Sorry.\n\nFirstly, I will refute my previous speaker. The previous speaker told you that the payment of ransom is small and it does not affect the revenue of the terrorists and it does not cause a terrible situation for the terrorists. But this is not true. Because if one person is caught by the terrorists, the government or someone who wants to save that person has to pay 1 billion yen or 10 billion yen or some very expensive money. So that's why, please imagine, the tank or rocket is about 1 billion yen or 10 million yen or so on. So, that's why, by one person, only one person, the terrorists can buy many weapons. And by buying only that weapon, many people are threatened by the situation. So, there is a possibility to be killed by the rocket or tank or so, a very serious, a very powerful weapon.\n\nSo, if around the world, the many, sorry, the many victims and many people pay so much money to the terrorists, terrorist groups, as my partner told you that the terrorists can get much money and can have possibility to expand their power and after that, around the world, there are many incidents by terrorists and many people will suffer from the threat by the terrorists. It is very harmful for the around the world, many people. Sorry, let me move on our argument.\n\nI will explain the, by payment of ransom, the terrorists will abuse that right to get the money, much money, and the harmful of the situation. One argument. And secondly, I will comparison the both side. Firstly, I will explain the payment of ransom is harmful. Okay.\n\n<POI> So, do you think that the bomb which killed thousands of people are 2 billion yen?\n\nIf the terrorists are followed by the government or police, it is harmful for terrorists itself. So, no. The payment of ransom should be expensive because also terrorists have risk to be watched by the government or catched by the government because of the interaction with the terrorists and government. So, terrorists have risk, so terrorists can need much money. So, in order to save the victims, the citizens have to pay much money, something billion yen.\n\nFirstly, I will explain the status quo, the payment of ransom. The payment of ransom is very expensive, so that's why the terrorists, as I told you in my presentation, there are many weapons in the terrorist group and they can kill other people. Please imagine, if one country, one person pay much money, rich man, and pay much money for terrorists, and terrorists have much money, and even if the people can only save that victim, important for me, many people around the world will be, other countries, other innocent citizens will be suffered from the threat by the terrorists. It is very harmful for other people or many citizens. So, that's why we have to save that many people.\n\nSecondly, I will comparison the both sides. After taking this plan, in the opposition paradigm, there are many incidents than now, and many people were killed by the terrorists, so we have to save that person by taking this proposal. Thank you very much."", 3: ""Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that today, all of the points, uh, today, the government side has not pointed out any justification in which why we can actually criminalize these people who actually want to just say solely want to save their families, their loved ones' lives. So we believe, so, uh, I'd like to point out, uh, why under the criminal justice system, this is not justifiable in my speech later on.\n\nSo, uh, we are here to oppose. So, uh, basically in my speech, I'd like to do, uh, three things. Firstly, I'd like to talk about, so why under the criminal justice system, why this is not justifiable. So we have, uh, brought the criteria here. And, um, secondly, I'd like to talk about how in the practical terms, this is, this plan is actually going to be counterproductive and, uh, this will actually, uh, kill many more innocent people under their paradigm. And thirdly, I'd like to talk about how, uh, how it is the state's responsibility and, uh, it is only one form of self-defense in this term.\n\nSo, uh, so yes, but before that, some couple of rebuttals to their points. Um, so firstly, about their point about, um, how we are going to, like, censor, uh, uh, security cameras and, like, hacking systems to these families or something. Well, we are very, uh, so we do not understand this vulnerability at all, right? How are these people going to be safe after doing this? And why is this going to be justified to continue censoring these, like, innocent people?\n\nAnd secondly, uh, they talked about the long-term benefit, how we can stop the source and it will, um, somehow, uh, lead to saving people. But they have not given any mechanism to this point, right? \n\nSo how will the stopping of payment of ransom actually save people, which I will talk about later on because the source of, source is not only ransom and there are many other criteria and factors that actually is empowering these terrorist groups.\n\nAnd, um, we believe that actually, uh, when we, uh, this causes, this causes detrimental harm because when we stop these families from being able to pay this ransom, what will actually happen is that these families will not forget this fact that they were not allowed to, uh, that they, that if they, like, pay this ransom, they are going to be criminalized. They will feel like they will be betrayed by the state. So it's actually rather just empowering the terrorists if they see that the state is like conflicting within themselves. So this is actually causes much more harm.\n\nAnd so, uh, and also, uh, there is like other ways, like we can, uh, we can at first like pay and save this one individual that will, that will definitely be, uh, that will definitely be, uh, their lives will be taken away under their paradigm. And later on we can combat the terrorists in other ways, which is, uh, which is much more going to be important and collect the money afterwards. So, uh, we should leave this choice to be able to, uh, pay this ransom. So I will talk about that later on. So moving on to this, just, uh, to why this is, uh, to my point.\n\nSo firstly, why this is not, why this plan is not justifiable under the criminal justice system. So in the criminal justice system, firstly, we need to see whether this act is illegal or not, right? So, um, in the case of the payment of ransom, it does not connect to the direct harm to somebody else. So like maybe the harm is like, no, maybe the harm is like, uh, might occur, but maybe it might not. \n\nSo in this criminal justice system, the punishment has to be objective. But in this case, it is extremely subjective because like even now there are still cases where, uh, people, uh, where like ransom is not paid. However, these terrorist groups still exist, right? So like for example, in the cases of ISIS, they export, uh, oil and they, uh, collect the money from that. And rather these kinds of things are, uh, these kinds of things are the factors and resources for these terrorist groups. So just by, uh, just by stopping this payment of ransom does not lead to, uh, the benefits that they want to talk about. So we have to, uh, combat in other ways.\n\nAnd secondly, uh, we have to, uh, consider the responsibility of these individuals. So, uh, if these, uh, so the people who paid the ransom has no intention to harm others, right? They solely want to save their families and their loved ones. So we cannot, um, just simply say that, uh, they are not, they are going to be criminalized just because they want to save these people. And it is not justifiable because it means that the, uh, criminalizing means that the state is actually going to ignore these people's, uh, these people's lifestyle. It's definitely going to be taken away under their paradigm.\n\nSo moving on to this practical benefits, uh, we believe that, um, uh, taking this plan is completely counterproductive and will cause many more innocent people's lives to be deprived. So, uh, there's going to be two consequences that can be, uh, that can be thought. \n\nSo firstly, uh, when we criminalize it, uh, uh, what might happen is that the families are going to, um, are going to negotiate with the criminal individually and secretly. So rather taking this plan is just going to push this, uh, push this payment of ransom underground. And, uh, if so, we believe it's a comparative better than the status quo when the state, when the state can actually intervene and the state can also, like, uh, negotiate instead of, uh, instead of making these families do it. \n\nAnd when the families do it individually and secretly, they will have to pay a huge amount of money. And rather this means that, uh, like huge, much more big, huger and bigger amounts of money. So rather this is going to empower terrorists, right? \n\nAnd secondly, uh, when, uh, uh, we should leave, like, a ground for these, uh, uh, to, like, negotiate and pay. Because when, like, we cannot pay making ransom, it's going to be difficult. These terrorists are not going to be satisfied, right? They are going to be desperate to get more money. So what will happen is that they are going to be kidnapped more people and they are going to kill more people. And for example, they will take, take over the states within that, uh, territory of their terrorist groups and they are going to kill innocent people and they are going to, like, uh, take over the, uh, banks and et cetera to get even more money and to empower themselves. And so we, we believe that this is actually going to kill many, many more innocent people under their power then.\n\nSo thirdly, uh, we believe that, um, uh, this, as, as we have already told you, uh, it is the state's responsibility that the state cannot seek and protect the safety of its citizens, right? So, uh, it is not justifiable to criminalize the act of saving someone as we have already told you. So we believe that the government has to do its best to save these people and completely ignoring them and completely just pushing them that saying that it is, uh, it is something, it is going to be criminalized is, uh, uh, is very detrimental, uh, is very harmful because, uh, it means that the state is going to actively kill someone, right?\n\nUh, they are going to ignore this one definite victim that is going to actually happen. So like, for example, even in today, like when the police is not there, others can try to save it, save someone even if, uh, even if, even if, even if it causes harms to others. So in this case, it is the state's responsibility to, uh, uh, to be able to leave a choice, at least leave a choice for these people to pay the ransom and, and save this one, uh, life that is definitely going to be deprived under their paradigm.\n\nSo, uh, so, uh, concluding my speech, when you consider how many lives are actually going to be taken away, how many innocent people are actually going to be killed, uh, the opposition side win about the uncertain benefits coming from the, uh, government side."", 4: ""The overall foundation coming from the government's guidelines are, in order to save the mass population, they are going to sacrifice the financial. But if it is possible, then we think it is better. \n\nHowever, we think that because of lack of mechanism, how they are going to de-empower the terrorists is unclear. And also, that it does not believe that they actually the weaken the terrorists. And also, perfectly to prevent terrorism, we oppose this proposal.\n\nBecause we think that by taking this proposal, we are going to sacrifice that individual who are not responsible for being captured by terrorists. And also, because the government has a responsibility to save these kind of individuals. \n\nSo, firstly, I'm going to point out why this government side does not have any work ability to prevent terrorism. And secondly, given that, what state should do and what is the responsibility of the state and the government.\n\nFirstly, the government has constantly told you, by taking this proposal, they are going to prevent, they are going to protect civilians. However, we don't think that it is the case. And lastly, as I and my partner have constantly told you, because the income of terrorists does not necessarily come from the ransom, it is not genuine. Because they have any way to gain the financial power, such as the exploitation, and so on.\n\nIn that case, if you want to do terrorism, what you need is a bomb, a gun, and so on. We don't think that they need to gain thousands of money in order to get that gun or bomb, ladies and gentlemen. We think that in those cases, we cannot understand why in their paradigm they can completely protect the citizens, and also why they can justify the sacrifice of citizens, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nSo, secondly, what state should do? As I said in the past speeches, though the auditing was different, there are people who are not responsible for their being captured. For example, spies, soldiers, journalists, and so on. These kind of people do not arbitrarily go to these kind of areas to be captured by terrorists, ladies and gentlemen. Because these kind of people are sometimes forced to go to these kind of dangerous areas, like government, companies, and so on.\n\nBecause we think that it is understandable that those people who are going to be forced to go to these kind of areas, and also selfishly being captured, it can be understandable, but there is no mention of that one. We think that in that case, those people were not fully responsible for their own act. They believed that the government had a responsibility to protect its citizens, and also there's no justification to prohibit to save these kind of people by the family or state, ladies and gentlemen. So because we believe that the government feels its responsibility to protect citizens, to ensure the safety of citizens, we believe that the government should make an effort to protect citizens.\n\nAnd also, as the opposition side constantly told you, because the reason why we have to prosecute the terrorists is to save its citizens. However, this government is going to sacrifice citizens in order to weaken the terrorists, ladies and gentlemen. Even if in that paradigm, the terrorism will constantly occur, and also they have not abandoned the protection of citizens, and also, however, in the paradigm of the opposition side, we are going to protect citizens, however, the situation does not slightly change.\n\nAs my partner has told you, because after taking this proposal, because the family wants to protect, wants to save their members of the family, they are going to do the negotiation with every secrecy. That is to say that the payment of ransom will not be possible, and also in that scenario, it is more harmful because we believe that there's no government protection in that negotiation, and also they cannot supervise the negotiation. In those cases, because we are against terrorism."", 5: ""Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen in this house. We want to cut the source and we want to protect the warse accidents such as more 100,000 or 1 billion people are killed by the gas or bombs in advance.\n\nSo and where after taking this plan, our government clearly showed that the citizen and terrorists, the government's stance that ransom is guilty. Terrorist group's action won't escalate. As usual, government remain to give money to terrorists. They request a yen and yen. And we want to stop this occasion and this motion is uniquely and only way to cut source of this case. \n\nOK. Let's move on my summarize. But I want to repeat my previous speaker. I have three refutations. Firstly, she said family cannot save because they cannot give ransom to terrorists. So it is pity. But it is not true. But as I mentioned in my constructive speech, but even if the ransom, they are family in the ransom, in the major case, the victim, the child will be killed by the terrorist. So even if they cannot save, in most case, they are pity. So we stop this. It is no problem. \n\nAnd secondly, she said we don't save the justification, so I want to justificate now. Namsung is equal to give money to terrorists. It is equal to support terrorist act. It is very guilty. Even if subjective, but support is very guilty. So it is in the criminal justice system, they should be criminalized, right? Yes. OK. \n\nAnd thirdly, they negotiate secretly. So this is a good point. But we believe that police is not so, so police can intervene also secretly not to know from terrorists. They do more secretly and they can, police is good, is specialist. So only families or not specialist are nervous people, negotiate secretly is more than our police can do well than our individual. So we think thanks to police, it is effectively solve the problem. \n\nOK. I want to summarize this debate. I have two crash points. Firstly, which plan can prevent worst case accidents such as one million people died. This plan, as I told you that in confused situation, people cannot think safely deeply and they do easily to give money to terrorists. So it is not saving victims and our opposition says countermeasures but it is no mechanism and they are irrational in public place. But I don't know, I don't know the mechanism. So our side is sperior.\n\nAnd secondly, which is better, protect victims and the large number of people. Opposition side strongly talk about one people's right, one people's right. But our side mentions again and again the major majority people's right. So which is more important to protect? The answer is surely the more people. So from that reason, our side's theory to opposition side. Thank you for listening.""}"
19,銀杏杯 Pre-Oct gov JOINTB vs opp HitU-E,"In case of a life-threatening illness or injury,THW not allow parents to deny medical treatment to their children on religious groups.","{0: ""Well, the children in the module, they have the right to decide, but there is a big problem about their life in the future. So, thank you ladies and gentlemen in this house. It is an honor for me to be here and deliver this speech in here.\n\nSo, today, I have three points today. One is that, sorry, I have one today. It is about the choice for the children. And, before we move on to my point, let me define this notion. So, the young children means that there are very little treatment, for example, that all kinds of the elementary school or kindergarten students have to offer to the young. So, and this medical treatment is a very suspected medical treatment. If we deny this treatment, maybe children will die.\n\nSo, let me move on to my point. It is about children's choice. So, fundamentally, we have the right to choose our life. So, the decision of where to live, where to belong, and so on. So, these kinds of issues about our life, we have the right to decide them. However, actually, these young children are so immature. They cannot understand how significant that issue is. So, instead of that, parents can choose their children. \n\nHowever, on this point, the most important thing is that, what parents can choose is limited to only reversible choices. Because, even though at that point, children are immature and cannot understand how significant each choice is, but after they grow up and understand the importance of each choice, they should have the right to live to these kinds of choices. Because, the life of the children is of the children themselves. So, the parents can, instead of choice by the parents, should be only temporary and reversible.\n\nHowever, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, it is a very suspected problem. Because, if we deny the birth of children, maybe children will die. So, even that, on children, the chance to be chosen will forever be lost. Even that, so children cannot be chosen in the future. So, it means we are depriving the very fundamental and important life, which is relevant to our life, from the children. So, it is very problematic.\n\nSo, in the first place, why we should have the right to choose for our life? Because, the most effective actor who understands our own love is needless to say, we are all. So that, I can understand my favorite, but I cannot understand your favorite, like this. So, we cannot understand completely each other. So, in order to be happy, in order to choose most enjoyable choice, we should by ourselves. \n\nAnd also, we government should admit it's right. Because, children is also the important individual in this nation. And actually, at that point, children is a very immature existence. And the opposition, I am going to say that, because they are immature. The parents have the right to choose for them. However, ladies and gentlemen, please remind this point.\n\nSo, this immature children will act in the future and be a very strong existence, very intellectual existence. They potentially have the ability to choose. And, this potential choice means that, we apply the right to choose from the individual. So, then why this choice is so important?\n\nSo, I will give an example. For example, we get name from the parents and it's really relevant to our love. Because, we use this name many years in whole life. However, if we do not favorite our own name or we suffer from this name, we can change it if we become the adult. It is also one of the potential right that admitted to the children. \n\nReligion is same. Because, actually, religion is very important part that contains the individual's life. So, it certainly changes the individual's life. Maybe, it brings children to be happy, however, it sometimes causes unhappiness. So, children should have the right to choose religion. However, in the future, when they understand what religion is, how severe, how important, how good, how vicious that religion is. So, defining that potential and important right from the children should not be admitted by the government."", 1: ""Today, I want to protest to the children in the religious community. And the religion is very important for believers, and religion has changed their identity and their living community. And keep religious teaching and law is very important because they can devote to the good in the world. By keeping the religious good, they can live comfortably in society and mentality.\n\nWe strongly believe that children are immature, so parents can make more better decision for children. Not only the aspect of medical care, but also living their children's life. \n\nSo I have two arguments. Firstly, in the status quo, such believers have a choice to be, to decide which medical care should be taken. And this is very good for them. And secondly, after taking this plan, they cannot decide to medical care, and they suffer from the fear of guilty. And they can make a living in the religious society.\n\nLet's move, before moving on to my first argument. Refutation to the government side is included in my argument. So firstly, under the status quo, they can can decide what is good for children of believers. They can decide which medical care is best for the children, so this is very good for them, and good for children's life. Because parents love their children very much, so they can make parents very familiar with the religion. So they know how serious situation they are in.\n\nAnd parents also know how serious situation a child is in, whether it's an illness or injury. So they can decide which medical care is best. Which is more important for children's future. So parents can make a decision for children. And comparing those two, and of course, parents want to save children's lives, so they make an effort to touch another medical care, which is not relevant for their just rule. So only a few cases, few medical care is not good. They cannot, so it is okay to deny medical treatment to their children, or they're just wrong.\n\nSo let's move on to my second argument. After taking this prompt, parents cannot decide their children's medical care. So it's very harmful for their children and their family, because broke religious rule is very serious program for them because they devote to the good for a long time to keep the religious rule, so they feel the guiltiness, and they feel they will be betrayed. So they feel very guilty, and it is very miserable life for them.\n\nAnd their community is very important for them, and their relationship is very, very strong. So as a community member, that family broke the religious rule, and that family is very bad for us. And they betray them, and they come to ignore them, or they don't make them to go to church and so on.\n\nSo their family living, if children live to buy medical care, however, they will be living a very, very hard life. So it's a very serious program, so we strongly oppose this motion."", 2: ""So the opposition said, as if children will not change the religion, as if parents have the right to choose and decide the children's religion in all their children's lives, but it's not true. Parents do not have the right to choose the children's religion forever, just temporary religion. So children have the possibility to change their religion.\n\nFirstly, let me introduce my previous speaker. Firstly, she said that religious people will feel guilty because of the medical treatment, but it's not true, because religious people can justify post-medical care. They will think if the children have the medical care, the government forced us to take medical treatment, so we are not against our religion. So they can justify their medical treatment, and the other people in the community of this religion will not think so badly of this.\n\nAnd also, she said about the possibility of children's blaimed, but if the children are blaimed by the other student or other children, the government can or school can save them. For example, the blaimed children will ask the school teacher of other religion, irrelevant to the community of the religion, so the teacher will think it is a problem, and can segregate the children from the community temporarily, and can move to solve the blaim.\n\nEven if there is a possibility of the feeling of guilty or being, but it is not more important than the children's forever right to choose their religion. Because, as my partner told you, children have the potential right to choose their religion, change their religion, and if children are killed in their little, defend their little, children will lose their right forever. So we government must protect the children's right to choose their religion.\n\nAnd second, she said parents can decide because parents love their children and understand their children. But it's not true. We human beings are not about ourselves, mostly us, so we must decide about ourselves. \n\nSo let me give you more arguments. Why is it so bad that children do not have body autonomies? As my partner told you, little children are immature in this consensus, and so to some extent, and could be possible extent, parents can decide when they are very little, for example, name of what they wear, and so on, because it is reversible in the future. But this is irreversible. We cannot bring the dead back. So children will lose their right to choose their religion forever.\n\nSo why is it so bad? I think it is a consensus, religion is important, religion is a very fundamental part of our life, but the opposition side only considers the parental religious issues and so on. But children are also affected by the religion greatly, and the way of thinking, the children's way of thinking might be different from the religion's thinking. They can change their religion when they grow up. \n\nSo children's right to choose their religion must be given to children, because unless we decide things ourselves, we cannot be happy. What is happy for me, I know the best. So if we don't have the choice, we cannot live freely as adults. It is a very unhappy thing, and children will die just bacause of parent's madness.\n\nChildren are not slaves, children are not dolls, children are not means of parental religion. Children have the right to choose their religion, and children have the right not to be a parent's religion, to be a god.\n\n<POI> We strongly believe that only living for all values is not an absolute value, because for example, there are a lot of things that are generally acceptable, so we don't believe that only living is so absolute, not an absolute value. How do you think about that? \n\nI don't talk about only living. Living has a possibility to change your life. Without living, we cannot sing, we cannot change our way of thinking, we cannot change our religion. So if we live, we have the possibility and certainly possibility to change our way of thinking. \n\nSo let me compare the importance again. The feeling of guilt or blame is reversible, and in some way, as I thought, we can solve the problem, but this is irreversible. As my partner and I have told again and again, we cannot bring the dead back, so living has a possibility to change our way of thinking, so we must say that this life could change our lives."", 3: ""So today, we recognize this debate is about which right is more prioritized, child's right or parental right in this situation. So, we strongly believe that the parental right should be prioritized for these children. So, why we can say so, I will explain it. \n\nSo, in my speech, I would like to make three points. First, why these people believe in religion and belong to the community. First, for these people, believing in religion is so important in terms of their life. And secondly, how serious are these children after being taken from death. And thirdly, comparing the bottom side in terms of children in the future.\n\nSo, before moving to my point, let me repeat what the government said. The government said that children can change their religion. But this is not true. Because firstly, the dogma is very different from other religions. So, they cannot easily change their religion. And also, these children live in this community when they were born. And they are taking the religious education. So, most of these children believe in this religion. So, concerning this fact, even if these children change their religion, they can't feel comfortable and more serious situation.\n\nSecond expectation, the government case is so unlikely. Because we strongly believe that if this situation is not related to the religious cases, of course, our parents allow the doctors to carry out the treatment. So, the situation that goes against religion is few, which these parents and other doctors conflict with each other's statement. So, the possibility of the government cases are so small.\n\nSo, please let me move to my first point. Why for these people believe in religion and belong to the community, believe in religion is so important in terms of their life? Because the religion is only after to give them mental stability. So, if these people strongly believe that if they obey the dogma, we can save their mental stability even after they die. So, however bad situation occurs to us, we can be saved after death. And that belief supports their life. \n\nBut on the other hand, if they don't obey these dogmas, they feel they cannot be saved by these gods. So, that is very mental harm. Why? Because in the future, they will despair their future. For example, the people in poverty are suffering from this poverty because they have no food and no clothing. But other people who are suffering from the relationship, for example, they are isolated from other friends and are bruised by their classmates. But these people, they betray against the dogma, they feel that if they... forever we cannot be saved. So, no way to help them save. So, in the first case, they kill themselves. But so, we strongly believe this belief is so important.\n\nAnd how seriousness will occur is emotional. So, as my partner said, the community, these children will be isolated from this community because the community member ignores their children because they feel that children betray their dogmas. So, if these children go to the school, other children don't talk about with them. And also, the children can't go to the church because they are afraid of criticizing themselves. And also, they feel that living is so hard and so pity. And at last, they feel that it is okay that I die in that situation. So, for this reason, we strongly oppose this motion. Thank you for listening."", 4: ""I would like to compare which side is better for religious families and religious children, particularly for children born into religious families. \n\nSo, I have two key points. Firstly, the parents have the right to decide children's medical care, especially when the child is very, very young. Secondly, I would like to compare the government's stance in the state of school and the time after taking this motion.\n\nFirstly, the government has argued that if the children die, they have no right forever and no possibility forever. However, this is a very small case. As the government has acknowledged, children are immature and cannot judge what is better for their entire lives. \n\nOn the other hand, parents have a deep understanding of religion, love their children immensely, and can make informed choices for their well-being. This enables parents to compare what is better for the children's future, whether it involves taking medical care that goes against religious laws or foregoing medical care that is detrimental to their religious beliefs. \n\nThe government's suggestion that it is possible for children to change their religion is deemed unrealistic. Children are influenced by religious education from a very young age, and as they grow up in the religious community, their ability to make independent choices may be limited.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second consideration. After taking this motion, families become very harmful in terms of mentality and living in the religious community. This harm is primarily attributed to the guilt they feel. So we strongly oppose this motion."", 5: 'So today, our positions are mainly focused on the people, the children, who will certainly follow their religion. Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to point out that there are also children who follow and not follow. And we also want to protect non-following children. And also, it is very important in the children\'s group, in the child\'s group, and also, we want to make sure that as long as we are living, we can deal with something useful, something that is relevant.\n\nWe have the possibility to change the situation. However, we dare. We are inspired. We dare. We certainly know that all possibilities. We have a 1,000% possibility to change the situation. It\'s observable. \n\nAnd also, there is a misunderstanding. So they said ""government just wants to prolong your life"", but this is not true. We want to protect the future life of children. Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to point out. So our first point is wrong. So parents are right. Can it decide children\'s whole life? The answer is no. So we want to save the children\'s life. It means that we want to let the children, children\'s future life to choose.\n\nAnd because fundamentally, we need to save the life to be admitted, and in the child\'s group, the two problems occur as I said. \n\nSo one is that who will be for that reason and who will not be for the reason? We do not clarify in the child\'s group in that unexpected situation. So in that situation, so in that situation, parents cannot decide that, parents cannot decide that never reverse the choice. Because it will certainly raise that precious opportunity to re-choose, it means that re-construct our own life for children. \n\nHowever, they explain that parents can decide it. Because, so after children follow their religion, so they will certainly, they will certainly sacrifice. But, but they just focus on the children who follow their, follow their religion. And they completely forget that children who won\'t be following their religion.\n\nAnd also, as I said, as long as we are living, we can change the situation. We have the possibility. However, we feel that, no, it\'s very significant. So, on this point that significance is that we can be superior than our opposition in terms of the significance of possibility. \n\nAlso, they never explain that. In that situation, why, why parents can choose such a severe decision that is related to their children\'s whole life, forever. So there\'s no explanation for why we cannot, we cannot understand this point that what they say is very vague.\n\nAnd also, the second point is that, so they merely talk about how important the relationship is. Yes, it\'s so very important. It\'s very important. That\'s why we should choose on our own. Such, such kind of, so very important life map that should be chosen by children themselves. Because, because the children\'s life is not their parent\'s one. We have our own life, our own time. So, we have to protect that, our children\'s future choice, not only life. So, following that, we are happy to be here.'}"
20,銀杏杯2016 Oct Fainal gov JOINT B vs. opp Kyoto B,THW criminalize the payment of ransom to terrorist groups,"{0: 'Our goal is not only to protect the nation, but also to fight against terrorism. So, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor for me to be here and speak. \n\nI have three points today when it\'s there. One, the governmental role is a safe citizen, but safe citizen doesn\'t mean who will be paid and what is good. The second is that this plan, so the payment paid for the terrorists, it means the opposition side of them. Opposition side is totally against our governmental role. Without it there, this plan certainly contributes to our governmental role. \n\nSo, let me explain it one by one. So, before that, I have to define this motion. This House means that the all government. As the government told us, we criminalize the payment for ransom to the terrorists. So, terrorists, please imagine about the islamic state and so on. \n\nSo, let me move on to my point. First is our governmental role. We, I think that maybe in this debate that safe citizen is the consensus of the state base, but safe citizen, what does it mean? It\'s completely different in these two sides. So, maybe they said that safe citizen means that safe office, but this is individual. Our means of safe citizen is the safe mass citizen. It\'s not individual, but societal level.\n\nSo, we government put priority on the mass citizen, not the individual citizen, because the governmental kind of role is making the happiness life of the whole nation. In order to achieve this goal, we have to set up the easy and peaceful society. So, if the system of society will collapse, we\'ll never get the happy life. So, in order to set up the healthy society, what we need is the citizen. So, mass citizen, not individual. In this point, we put the priority on the non-individuals, but the mass. And so, the society system means that, so only we go shopping in the town or exciting music labs. So, go peacefully and go overseas like that. We can enjoy ordinary daily life. I think that\'s the ultimate happiness in this world.\n\nHowever, the second point is that the payment for the long-term is certainly against this goal. Why? So, A, is that, pay for terrorism group is that, it is a tax to the government to put on this kind of list. Because once we pay to the terrorists, they\'ll recognize ""Yes, we can keep sleeping from this government, we can get the money.""\n\nWhy? Why terrorism group do kidnapping or get hostage means that they want money. So, ISIS and so on, it\'s a very isolated organization. So, they are very struggling to deal with that money. So, in order to get money, they kill a kid, kidnapping, get hostage and again and again, and get money from them. So, if they recommend that our government, from our government, they can derive the money, so they do again and again, so that this kind of list of being hostage will be certainly equal.\n\nThe second, so B, is that, to get money is that, it means that to cooperate to the terrorism is certainly best. Because, so this kind of terrorism is that, certainly outside social group, so that it try to destroy our peaceful or healthy society. Because, also, also, also, and give them use that, so give them the money to buy weapons or payment for the, payment for the terrorism and so on, so that it certainly be a power to the IS. So, in two points, payment for the terrorism, it is certainly against our governmental law to save health and society.\n\nHowever, third point. So, this plan can be solve this problem\n\n<POI> So do you mean that you want to make those victims of ransom? So you neglect those victims of kidnapping rather than potential hostages? \n\nSo, one is that, so, so after our friends do that, that this kind of list of hostage should be certainly decreasing. \n\nThe second is that, we, we actually clearly know the payment, but other kinds of ways, for example, so a few years ago, so when our Japanese, Japanese hostage by, hostage by the ISIS, we are co-operated by the Turkey government or closed, closed citizens and we try to save them. And it\'s like this kind of the way we ordered it. \n\nAnd the third point is, even if actually we cannot, we cannot actually succeed in this kind of, succeed, but, even though, but, rather we prefer, prefer order in the mass citizens rather than individuals.\n\nSo, third point is that, after taking this proposal, A, the, the list of the target hostage is certainly decrease. Because as I said, so the intention of the kidnapping or hostage is the money. If they recognize that, even though we do kidnapping or hostage, we cannot get that money, can stop them such kind of an inefficient way. Because they cannot get money. And succesfully we can decrease the future number of victims of the hostage. \n\nThe second B is that, to equalize the ISIS, their money, so that, it\'s definitely equalize their money to buy weapons or salary for the army, so it\'s the same, so ISIS can get weaker and weaker. We can, we can destroy the society\'s threatened power itself.', 1: ""Ladies and gentlemen, in order to save citizens from mass attack, we should introduce this plan. But ladies and gentlemen, that is a strange story and an indirect story. Why? Because we can prevent a mass attack for citizens by terrorism by a more direct plan. For example, airbombing or government restriction directly to the terrorism. For example, actually, we're doing some scheme to the terrorists in ISIS by, for example, airbombing and actually killing readers of ISIS. Actually, they're weakened by airbombing. So actually, we do work by a direct, more direct plan. It cannot be the reason to criminalize payment for ransom to achieve a government-side goal.\n\nWe think that the opposition I said was that we should save those who kidnapped by paying ransom to terrorism. And that is really important as a government, as the parents. \n\nI'm going to explain in the first bit, thank you, about the opportunity to save those who are kidnapped, and secondly, about freedom of choice of those who pay ransom.\n\nLet's move to the first point, which is about the opportunity to save those who are kidnapped. So, under the status quo, why terrorism groups are kidnapping people, or we can see that they're generally kidnapped by ISIS or children, innocent children are kidnapped by terrorism. So, after that, in order to save them, the other people, or parents, or partners, or sometimes the states state themselves that pay ransom to terrorists. And that is the only way to save the children, or those who are kidnapped. Of course, for example, we can find a case, a Japanese case, a Japanese journalist kidnapped by ISIS. When the Japanese government denied paying ransom, they are killed, actually. \n\nLadies and gentlemen, but if they pay ransom, certainly, actually, they can save those who are kidnapped. For example, in the Spanish government, or the European government, or the same journalist, by paying ransom to ISIS, actually, we have the case. Actually, it's reasonable to say that the kidnappers, if we pay ransom to them, those who are kidnapped are released, and actually, we can save them. No, thank you. No, thank you.\n\nAfter taking this plan, what will happen? Even though those who pay ransom have no responsibility for the children, for the partners to be kidnapped, but they are criminalized to pay ransom. And after that, what happens? Of course, they cannot pay ransom, or sometimes terrorism kills the people. And of course, the terrorism is no use demanding ransom to the people, ransom to the victims. But they need money, so actually, that's why they do ransom. \n\nSo what will happen? So they start human trafficking, they start organ trading. By doing that, by any means, they want money. So they do inhumane things more overall. \n\nSo actually, what will happen? Even though we can save them by paying ransom, they won't be saved. They will die, killed by terrorism. The important thing in this argument is that paying ransom is a certain way to save those who are kidnapped, I mean the innocent people. And that's the importance in this first argument. So one of the priorities is not only the mass, but individuals. \n\nLadies and gentlemen, of course, we need to protect mass citizens from bombing. But I mean, I say that in order to save mass citizens from a terrorism attack, we have a more effective plan, for example, air bombing, a more direct plan to do that. So really criminalizing the paying ransom is too far from their purpose. That is why we shouldn't criminalize paying ransom.\n\nLet's move on to the second point, which is freedom of choice. Where freedom of choice is important. Let's look at two things. \n\nThe first is whether it's a rational choice or not. The second is harm to others. First, the rational choice. In the case of children kidnapped by terrorism, for the parents, children is a really important existence. So even if they pay ransom to terrorism, as the parents, they want to save their children, because the parents have the duty to protect their children. So that is the rational choice, to pay ransom to terrorism.\n\nAnd second, in the case of the government, if the government pays ransom to release those who were kidnapped by paying ransom, is it also we can say that it's a rational choice? Because as the government, it's the duty to protect citizens, and save the citizens from a serious situation. So we can say, also in this case, we can say that it is a rational choice. \n\nAnd let's move on to the second point, which is harm to others. Of course, firstly, we don't know how to use them. We don't know, of course, it is uncertain that the terrorism, how the terrorism use their money to get from their ransom. \n\nMoreover, they commit crime, they commit human crimes, as I say, kidnapping, because they need money, because of lack of money. Or if they have enough money, they don't do that. It's a risk, it's high risk to be arrested. It's high risk to be, it's organization. So we can say, we can assume that because they don't have much money, because they need money, they start good human crimes. After, if we paying ransom, enough ransom to those terrorism groups, totally, when we say totally, because the kidnappers, I mean terrorism, lose the motivation to have a risk. So totally, we can say these cases, inhuman cases will decrease. And that is why we put this point."", 2: ""Today's opposition side said that we must save the victims of kidnapping, but we want the idea that kidnapping itself will disappear. So in order to achieve this goal, we must take this motion. Only opposition side paradigm will not erase the kidnapping itself. \n\nFirstly, let me speak to my previous speaker. Firstly, he said that we can surely save the victims of hostage if we pay the money. But it's not certainly because, for example, I guess IS people's kidnapping, when the kidnapping occurred, the movie was thought that even if we pay the money, the terrorists will not surely release the hostage because they are malicious people and do not always save the hostage.\n\nSecondly, he said that terrorist group will try to earn money with other ways like organ transplants and so on. But who will sell the organ? Even if someone sells the organ, the difference is that the money terrorists can earn at one time. We think the target of terrorist kidnap is mainly journalists and they demand money to nations because nations have much money and terrorists can get much money from the nation the most. So the kidnapping and demanding the money to nations is a very unique way for terrorists to earn money easily. \n\nSo let me move on to my arguments. There are two arguments. Firstly, let me reinforce my partner's argument about undertaking this planned program. And second, why we can justify this motion.\n\nUnder the status quo, kidnapping of hostages will never disappear as my partner told you because kidnapping can get much money easily. For example, a bank robbery is very risky for terrorists because a bank is very high security and one person is not so secure. \n\nBut after taking this motion, kidnapping will disappear or at least will certainly decrease because nations will never give terrorists money and terrorists know even if we kidnap, we can't get money. Also, journalists who will go to those areas of terrorism, they will care more about their security. For example, they will hire bodyguards and they will be more careful. So the risk will be lower.\n\nSecond problem, payment will kill more people. Money given to terrorists will be used to achieve the terrorist's goal by violent way. For example, as my partner told you, much money will allow terrorists to buy weapons, many latest strong weapons. So terrorists will kill drastically lots of people rather than just the kidnapping of one person. For example, sometimes quite a plane attacked the big building and one thousand or one million people died. \n\nSo if the terrorist group got the money, they will surely use this money to the crime because they are malicious people and they are willing to use violent way or crime to achieve their goal. So payment surely kills people. So paying money to terrorism means cooperating terrorism. Government cannot cooperate terrorism means crimes and killing people.\n\nThey said that government needs a direct way to save people. But we see indirect murder is also murder. Government must not indirectly kill people. \n\nAlso, he did not explain about the complete way to save mass people. So please give me the complete way to save mass people. \n\nHow we can justify? For example, in case of disaster, many people are injured. We, or doctors, prioritize people who have higher possibility to be saved or higher possibility to be cured. They prioritize more people because they cannot save all people. They must prioritize more people because the more people will be saved, the more people will be happy. So it is the same to this notion. \n\nYes, we think that sometimes, even if the death case starts, some individual hostages will die. But if the number, let's compare the number of people's life. One individual or mass, one thousand or one million people, of course, we must prioritize the number of mass people. So therefore, we can justify."", 3: ""Their goal was to save, but potentially kill, the mass citizens. And their policy is to criminalize paying ransom to terrorist group.\n\nOkay, if you want to save a potentially killed mass citizens, then why not kill the terrorist groups themselves? I mean, destroy the organization itself. If we can't directly air bomb or directly attack, or have an economic restriction, then we can comparatively decrease the power of terrorist groups. Then if those kinds of power would be decreased, then those terrorist groups could not kill those potentially killed mass citizens, then their goal is achieved. We believe that their policy is not in this goal. That's what I believe.\n\nSo, before going to the argument, let me rebuttal first. Before we go to the rebuttals, I would like to analyze actors in this debate. There are two main actors we have to protect. First, it's the individual citizens who are being kidnapped. And second, those potentially killed mass citizens. \n\nOkay, let's go from the first actor. In their paradigm, in the United States, if the individual citizens were kidnapped by the terrorist group, they have only one way to save those citizens, that is, to ransom them. And they told us that if we can actually cooperate with the government, they can achieve this. First of all, there is no case that we can achieve this. They said that we can actually cooperate, but in fact, those hostages were killed. So we believe that kind of government cooperation is unmeaning.\n\nWhy is that meaningless? This is our second reason why we have rebuttals. Why is that impossible? Because the terrorist groups need money. If they need money, and then they have to exclude the government from the hostages, they will desperately kill those potential hostages from the government, and they have those incentives to have it, because they need money. \n\nSo that's why we believe that even if the government cooperates, it's impossible to save citizens just by other means than ransom. So we believe that ransom is the only way to save those kidnapped citizens. Then, if we can criminalize those citizens, then those citizens will surely be killed. So we believe that those individual citizens are important. \n\nWhy are those individual citizens important? Because they are inherent, and they will surely be killed if we don't pay ransom.\n\nBecause the second factor is talking about the potentially killed mass citizens, we cannot understand the potentially killed mass citizens. And in fact, there are a lot of victims. We believe that this is not inherent. But in fact, those individual kidnapped citizens are inherent. Those people will surely be killed. That's why we believe that it's important.\n\nSo, after taking this plan, we believe that after taking their policy, what will happen? They say that the case of kidnapping will decrease, but we think that is not true. Why is that? Because kidnapping is a rather easier way to save those money. If we kidnap those people, then we can use those people from using or selling those people themselves or use the foreign currency. And there are other ways of taking money other than ransom. \n\nSo that's why we believe that even though we criminalize the ransom, those citizens will still be kidnapped. So that's why we believe that even if we take this motion, those individual kidnapped citizens will not be rescued. \n\nSo, if we do not have any other way, then there is a way of ransom. And if we can pay ransom, we can actually help those citizens. That's why we believe to help individual citizens, we should not take this motion.\n\nLet's talk about the second factor, the potentially killed mass citizens. Their logic was that if terrorists can gain money, they will buy weapons, and then they will kill mass citizens. Okay, there are two logics. And I would like to go through those two. \n\nFirst logic was that if they gain money, they will buy weapons. Okay, the terrorist group who purposed it is that they have to kill people. So even though the terrorist group do not have money, they have to have an air bombing, they have to kill. So they have to have their attack on the expense of the group member itself. \n\nSo if they gain money, what will they do is that they will actually use the money for themselves. For example, under the current situation, people in ISIS are poor. So what they do is that they do a raid or they rob something because they don't have money. But if they get money, then they can use this money for a living. And those inhumane crimes will actually decrease. In that case, those victims of that crime will actually decrease. Even those kind of zero-life manufacturers will be safe in that potential.\n\nSecond, we believe that in the first place, if we stop ransom, those terrorists will not stop killing people. Why is that? Because their purpose is money and they have other ways to gain money by attacking people. So they will not stop that. But if we cannot destroy the terrorist group itself, those people will not be safe at all. So we believe that potentially killed massivists will be killed on their part in the first place.\n\nOkay, what happens after taking this plan? Because their action is that we destroy the terrorist group itself, and destroy the group themselves, we believe that if we directly attack and decrease the power of terrorist groups, then we don't have enough power to attack the people as a backlash. So we believe that those kind of potentially killed massive citizens will decrease in our part rather than their part. So that's why we believe that the criminalization of the ransom terrorist group is not relevant to the disposal of the terrorist group.\n\nSo how about our argument itself? Because we believe that in the first, individuals in the territory can protect them by paying ransom, and this is clear because if you pay ransom, they will lose individuals, and we go back to our case.\n\nWell, I've finished the analysis of two actors, so I would like to compare the two reports. Okay, so as I told you, individual kidnapped citizens are inherent, and if we don't pay ransom, they will be killed.\n\nOn the other hand, potentially killed mass, we cannot expect how many people will be killed in the first place, and furthermore, we cannot even understand whether those citizens would be killed. So, I think, we don't think that amount is important. \n\nWe believe that if someone would be surely killed, and we think that not the potentially killed citizens, but rather the inherent individual kidnapped citizens, saving those people is more important than potentially killed citizens. That's why I believe that we have to save the individual citizens inherently, and we don't think that all of those will. If we pay ransom, we can surely save those people. We are happy to propose."", 4: ""Ladies and gentlemen, the important module used today is to save citizens. And we, both sides, agreed, both sides, the purpose was that. So let's compare the government side's view and our citizens' side's view, first. And secondly, in which case citizens can save the citizens more and more and less and less.\n\nSo firstly, let's look at the government case. The government case was that they should try to take this motion in order to protect mass citizens from terrorism. Citizens mentioned that terrorism demands money for kidnapping. So, for example, they kidnapped a journalist and they demand money from the nation. And they get much money by kidnapping. And if you pay, we call it terrorism, it should be justified. And terrorism is a strong offense. So that is a problem and potentially kill citizens.\n\nOf course, we can save the mass citizens under the status quo now by directly attacking, airbombing terrorists. That is a more effective and more direct plan. And so that is really superior to the indirect plan and far plan. \n\nAnd secondly, we are consintantly saying that we don't neglect its citizens, we save the citizens. And it's also important to look at each one's citizens and save them by paying ransom in a certain way.\n\nAfter taking this plan, we can't pay ransom for the citizens. Of course, we surely cannot save each individual citizen for kidnapping of terrorism. And also saying that the number of ransoms don't decrease. Unfortunately, moreover, when we look at it, it won't decrease. That is a problem. And so, of course, that is a problem. That's our view of this debate today.\n\nSo let's first look at the citizens, in which case the citizens are more saved. And the government side, on the government side's base, basically the government side's view, that after taking this plan, unfortunate story, ladies and gentlemen, the number of ransoms will increase. Why? \n\nThey mention that they kidnap and demand money from nations and get much money. So when they kidnap, after taking this plan, the nations, of course, don't pay ransom to the terrorists. So what happens? \n\nOf course, they need money. So that is the motivation for terrorism, that they throw organ transplants for profits. Of course, they can get money, but the money they get from organ transplantation for profit is less than they get from nations. So they need to kidnap more and more people to get certain money. So the case of ransom will surely increase after taking this motion, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen. The story that the victims of kidnap will decrease after taking this motion and attacks on mass citizens will desrease is uncertain and far less direct plan and more uncertain plan.\n\nAnd compared to government side's view, the opposition side's view was that we surely save the citizens who were kidnapped, individuals, we can save them. And of course, we can protect and potentially kill more citizens more by directly bombing, directly killing the terrorists, which is more effective and more direct. \n\nAnd because of these reasons, we can save more citizens by not taking this motion. And that's why we proposed it."", 5: ""So in this debate, I have no need to explain how important it is to save the nation because it's the competition. The issue of competition is that of saving the nation. How we achieve this goal is the issue of competition. So let me summarize today about this problem.\n\nTheir point is that, one, the sacrifice to the payment. So the sacrifice to payment is the first point we'll come back to. The second is that, due to that payment, the citizens, the neighbors are sacrificing themselves. The third is that if the artists do not vote in a poor, they will stop snatching because they have no need to do it. \n\nHowever, it's all not true. First, it is very doubtful that it is really there after our payment.\n\nSecond is that it doesn't result in a negative because at present, they are falling in poverty. If they did get the money, they just allow it to collect there, not only attacking. As long as they have money, they use it all, so they need money. They need money always. \n\nThe last point is that it's my point that it's just a cooperative effort until those votes. We can save the individual citizens at that time, but behind that hostage, we expect 100,000.\n\nThe second point is about payment. It's that payment, they need a sacrifice. But I cannot say that it's really there, sacrificing themselves, so it's very doubtful. So it's meaningless. \n\nThe last point is that if they are not falling in poor, they do not kidnap, or they are just eager to go so that they do not stop terrorism. These are all misunderstandings. Why? Because at the same time, they need money; they need money always. \n\nThe second is that they are achieving, they are just eager to leave this globe. However, it's not true. For example, ISIS is not one domestic group; it hired many kinds of foreign citizens from other nations. So they need a lot of payment, and they are falling in poverty.\n\nOn the other hand, our cases, the most important thing is that we can certainly beat terrorism itself. It's certainly real. We can solve the root cause of the issue, and they are just giving up the solution over time. We want to solve this motion from the root cause. \n\nSo first is that we can see no more expected hostages because we stopped paying them.\n\nThe second is that we do not cooperate with them worldwide. We define this time, this house means worldwide, so the world government, so worldwide we stopped to pay them. \n\nSo they are certainly falling into poverty, and they have no need, no money to do terrorism, so the terrorist group certainly collapses. This is the fundamental goal, and it's the only way to achieve the world. Thank you.""}"
