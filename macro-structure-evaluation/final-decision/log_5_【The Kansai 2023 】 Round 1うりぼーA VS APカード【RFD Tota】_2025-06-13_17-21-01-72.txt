# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #5 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

## Government 1st
Thank you judges. What we think is very important during the pandemic time is helping as many people as possible and passing those things. In those circumstances, these kind of patents will slow the enhancement of development of new drugs or vaccine or those kind of things, or the accessibility of those things. So we are very happy to propose this motion. 

So two things I'm going to talk about in my speech. Firstly, how patents will bother or slow the enhancement of development and the accessibility of drugs. Secondly, how in our society we will be safe, which is the counter of the status quo. 

But before moving on, I'm going to talk about a couple of models or definitions. First, like Western Pharmaceutical Company. I think, as you know, it's like Pfizer or Moderna, which has a large pharmaceutical company with large money and those things. And what we mean by the release of patents, first of all, the scope of the patents will be more pandemic related. So it is not like all patents, for example, when it is the COVID time, COVID vaccine or drugs that will be. And also in the world where there are patents, you have to pay fee for using that or maybe those kind of companies have to occupy the knowledge, have a right to knowledge. But what we think from the government side, when there are no patents, it is more open those kind of disclosure of the information of the society or those kind of things. 

So moving on to the first argument, how patents will bother the enhancement of development and the accessibility of drugs. 

So at the conclusion, I won't say patents will slow and lessen accessibility for three reasons. Firstly, simply, when there are patents, you cannot get the skill or use that skill because the corporation doesn't have the incentive to share those knowledge. And secondly, you have to sell tons of money to use that patent. For example, if you want to use the patent of the company A, company B has to pay a lot of money, which is unlikely to happen. And thirdly, if there are less types of medicine and when there are, first of all, when there are patents, it means there are less types of medicine. In those circumstances, the prices of the drug or the vaccine will be high. So the conclusion here is that patents will slow the development of the new drugs and lessen the accessibility of drugs. 

So why is this problematic? For two reasons. Firstly, when there are pandemics, these kind of poor people cannot access the drug or the vaccine. Maybe in a country like Japan, where there is a lot of money, or a rich country, the government has the budget to distribute the money to the citizens. But in the majority of cases, especially in poor countries, they don't have enough money to do that. So that means, in the worst cases, you don't have the right to get the vaccine or get the drug, which means you are dead in those kinds of times. 

And secondly, why it's problematic is that it will slow the development of the new drugs. For example, maybe company A has made an original COVID-19 vaccine, and company B are very specific and talk us through at the Delta Cup or another cup, but in that world, you don't have the patent, you don't have the rights to use the patent, or the patent is not released later, please. And so, company B have to do from the scratch, right? They have to use tons of money, they have to use tons of time to do the clinical trial of those vaccines, right? In those circumstances, it will lessen the development of the new drugs. So why this is important is that when the pandemic comes, you have to get the drugs or the vaccine to help many people. 

<POI> We can see that helping people is quite important, but even if it is not a situation of the worldwide pandemic, still there are a lot of patients who are struggling with diseases. Why you can focus on the situation of those kind of worldwide pandemic? Why you can have the right to still do the property that you recover investigation? 

My partner will answer this question. 

So moving on to the second point, how our side is better. What we think is that in the world where the patents will be released, it will fasten the development of the new drugs, because for two reasons. 

Firstly, when the patent is disclosed, it means that many companies have access, more competition will happen, and when there are no patents, many companies have the opportunity to get that information. That means that company A can use that information, and company B can't use it. So in that circumstances, maybe in the world there are patents. This Western first company who has a patent will not feel like making development, but because all the information is disclosed, those companies will be rushed to do another. 

And the second reason why it will fasten the development, is that each company can use the proficiency skill, or their specialty of that institute. For example, maybe company A is good at designing clinical trials or using digital tools and twins, like using AI things, or maybe company B can use it. In those circumstances, each company can use their own skill, which means that the development gets scaled from those original information. So we think, because of two reasons, we think it will be fastening the development, and the accessibility of the drug will be opened. For this reason, I'm happy to propose. Thank you.

## Opposition 1st
Thank you, Chair. Patent right has proven to be a powerful engine of innovation, driving progress and fostering unprecedented technological advancement. On this side of the government, unfortunately, disincentivized pharmaceutical corporations not to innovate this kind of important vaccination or medication during times of economic. That's why, unfortunately, from the perspective of practical consequences, the more people will not be able to medicate it, unfortunately. And in the principal consequences, unfortunately, today's government is unfortunately invading the important property rights of the patent. 

I have three things to tell you. Number one, I will explain the counter model as opposition. And number two, I will explain the principle argument and why the patent should work as important property right and why government shouldn't invade it. And number three, I will talk about today's government, unfortunately, disincentivizing the medical innovation. And the more people is going to die in their power. 

So let's move on to the first issue about the model. So first of all, I'm going to support that, of course, the status quo situation, right? So pharmaceutical corporation still has a patent. And so the other company wants to use the technology for a patent. Of course, they need to pay to some extent of money for the corporation. 

So number two, and we are very happy to compromise, to introduce license fee to obligatory that kind of the Western pharmaceutical corporation needs to accept a release to some extent of patent with a significant amount of fee. And even if this fee is unacceptable or the sky-high expensive and other corporations not actually accessible, we can, of course, adjust the amount of fee to the acceptable one. So this is the best compromise I can do. 

And more than that, we are, of course, very happy to subsidize those medical corporations to actually harsh the development of medical medicine or vaccination. We'll be happy to enhancement of the investment or lending. So this is our model. 

So let's move on to the first issue in terms of principle level of the patent, why it has to work as important property, right? So we need to admit Western pharmaceutical company patent as very important as a property, right? So forcing the pharmaceutical corporation to release the patent is invasion of their property, right? So why is that? Because they actually made a lot of effort for many two reasons. 

Of course, they are the only one spend so much cost, right? So they, of course, invest on the lab. They develop machine or mathematical model. They, of course, invest massive amount of human resources, hiring outstanding scientists or engineering members and so on, which is a unique effort that other corporation is not doing. That's why they can reach out to the development and they can get patent. 

And number two, of course, they spend so much time to develop this kind of patent, right? And this is not a short-term effort. They actually use the technology for a long time and they develop this kind of patent with spending so much long-term perspective, such as 5 to 10 years or not only just a few months, a few days, right? So this kind of consistent effort time and the cost is an important reason. So the result that they develop can actually reach the good innovation, such as effective vaccination, such as mask to eliminate molecule of COVID, such as good medication against the pandemic, like flu, influenza, or so forth, right? 

So those all medical development, it's all attributed from corporation's effort, hoping their sustainable profit as a form of patent, right? So government actually ignore this kind of effort and certainly they set the arbitral criteria of emergence and this kind of situation is not acceptable. 

Before moving on any... Okay, let's move on to... So analogy of this, why this is not acceptable is, of course, the first would be, so even if there's any scarcity, even if there's any shortage of food or on this kind of situation, of course, government cannot certainly say they're going to nationalize the food factory or food industry, right? Even if the AI development is actually raising and probably this unlock their many trouble in the world, of course, we cannot force AI corporations such as just GPT or Microsoft to release their patent related to AI industry, right? So we are not saying that because we admit the importance of property, right? 

So let's move on to the second issue about decentralization of innovation. So of course, as I said, to develop this kind of medical products, it costs actually a lot, right? So like I say, they need to invest a lot and they need to develop their unique mathematical model or something like this, right? And also they are not actually certain whether or not this kind of medication is actually going to be needed in the future because it's very uncertain whether or not the development of the current medicine is going to be effective in the future or whether or not actually another pandemic will come in the future. They can also assess that.

But as long as there's the patent to create a sustainable money for company, that's why they have actually massive motivation to keep innovating and investing these kinds of products. So for example, in the case of pandemic, of course, vaccine and medicines demand increase. That's a lot of corporation wants to develop effective products. And if one company developing the outstanding product, of course, other corporation is also wants to use the patent to get the technology and they can also have massive incentive to sophisticate the product with the patent, right? That's why this kind of patent is actually important key essence to unlock difficulty of innovating medication. 

What's going to happen in after plan? First of all, of course, there's very few profit for pharmaceutical corporation. It's not a profitable situation at all, right? So that's why the research and development fee is going to be cut for this kind of corporation. That's why the important, for example, the medication against the COVID or flu is also going to be cut when they're going to probably move to other industry, such as just the investing on generic medication, which can be effective but not critical for the COVID situation. This kind to save more people, to preserve principle importance of patent.

## Government 2nd
First, I want to start with the characterization of the large corporations. In order to prove without this policy, malicious utilization of the patent will happen, and they dominate profit by excluding small corporations or venture corporations who have the potential to produce that important medicine or technology as much as possible on their side of the house, which means their counterproposal is too soft to prevent this policy. 

We see in the status quo, those large corporations strongly exclude venture corporations or startup corporations on their side of the house. We see large corporations try to purchase the patent, which venture corporations or small corporations also have in the status quo. Therefore, those new important technologies or knowledge will be dominated by large corporations on their side of the house. Also, we see, evergreen, once their patent will be expired, large corporations try to introduce similar patents in order to perpetuate this unfair social structure for the small or venture corporations. Therefore, other consequences, those technologies, medicine, will be totally dominated, and malicious utilization of the patent will happen on their side of the house. 

Why do you see this actually happen? It's very simple. Because corporations, large corporations, are inherently short-sighted because they have to cater to the interests of the shareholders. We see in the case of the breach of trust, we look at the case of the British. Shareholders can cause lawsuits against a company as long as corporations don't take action to maximize their benefit if they don't cater to the profit of the shareholders. That's why those malicious utilizations strongly happen without a disposal under the model. 

Opposition may say, hey, those corporations have a natural incentive to care about reputation, et cetera. That's why those malicious utilizations are unlikely to happen, et cetera. But I don't think this is likely because, as I already talked to you, corporations are inherently short-sighted and profit-seeking. Therefore, the malicious utilization are likely to happen on their side of the house. 

And also, what we got from side of the opposition is that under our model, this incentivization to research and development could happen, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think this is likely in the first place. Because when it comes to the pandemic, when it comes to the pharmacy, obviously, large demands strongly exist. In the case of COVID-19, many people try to vaccinate or utilize medicine again and again. For example, in Japan, at least three times, those people have to utilize. Therefore, even if large corporations lose the patent, anyway, those corporations have a natural incentive to enter the industry of the pharmacy, and so they have a natural incentive to commit the research and the development to begin with. 

And secondly, especially when it comes to the pharmacy, their products directly connecting to the reputation, increasing reputation, because their products directly connecting, like saving life, saving precious life. Therefore, if their knowledge of technology will be compromised because of this policy, still those corporations have a natural incentive to enter their industry to begin with. 

And also, we tell you, disincentivization rather happens on their side of the house. Because, as I already talked to you, many of the technology or medicine will be taught to be dominated by the large corporations, right? Once a venture corporation or small corporation, even if a small corporation or venture corporation tries to opt into that industry, their knowledge, their technology, are totally dominated by the large corporations. Therefore, those corporations who have less financial capacity lose incentive to enter this industry more and more on their side of the house. But before that, yes. 

<POI> I understand to some extent, there is a huge demand for medication during the pandemic. But by releasing patent and thousands of companies actually started selling the same products, which is not actually profitable, how still your side of the pharmaceutical corporation has a massive incentive for innovation? 

Obviously, even if the patent will be disclosed to the public, for example, as my partner already talked to you, each corporation has their own strong point, right? For example, like a specific knowledge, like a corporation A has a specific knowledge of A, corporation B has a specific knowledge of B, or et cetera, et cetera. Therefore, yes, we can see an important basis of the medicine or important basis of the technology are shared by every single corporation. However, another corporation can put additional benefit or additional functionality of the technology or medicine or those kind of things. Therefore, by doing so, each corporation easily differentiates each other. Therefore, those corporations still can gain the benefit on our side of the house. And also we think what we got from their side of the house, like the invasion of the right of the corporation. 

But I think, as I already talked to you, when it comes to the pandemic, especially many dying right now, the right of the corporation should be compromised in order to maximize the potential of the corporation to begin with. Because as I already talked to you, those corporations are strongly blocked by the larger corporation in the status quo. Therefore, in terms of corporate social responsibility, I think their rights should be compromised to begin with. Therefore, we think we have to propose. Thank you very much for that fine speech. Thank you. 


## Opposition 2nd
Existence of the patent is a rarely activated competition, we believe, which can drive businesses to continually improve their products and services. This is actually giving benefits to the consumer and society as a whole. That is what we are happy to hear about this motion. 

Before moving on to my substantive, let me quickly go back to what the previous speaker said. First of all, he said venture companies do not take action to invest or develop new technology. We don't think so, even in current situations. A lot of venture companies can take enough action. For example, let me take the example of the case of COVID-19. Moderna is actually a venture company. This was built after 2010. Of course, we already know that they do not have enough monetary capacity, but if they can invest in beautiful technology, they can invest it by a lot of investors from the whole of society, and they can earn money from the society. We think even in this house, enough technology is actually made by those kinds of companies. 

Second of all, he said that the companies just take the short-term benefits. We don't think so also. Because such companies also invest from a lot of people, at the moment, if they just focus on the short-term benefits from the society, on the other hand, they also have to consider long-term benefits. For example, utilizing their patents or continuously selling new products to the society. That's why we think such malicious usage of patents is less likely to happen. Because if they maliciously make so many expensive fees to just use such patents technology, of course, no one would want to use it. That's why we don't think that kind of situation is actually happening. 

Okay, next, moving on to my substantive. First of all, while releasing the patent is a completely undermined motivation to develop new technology, and unfortunately, the existence of information itself is obviously declining in that part of this house. Secondly, as a property right, why we should not arbitrarily steal such kind of property from the entire company, even in the case of pandemic cases. So, lastly, let me compare each part. 

First of all, while releasing the patent is completely undermined motivation to develop new technology. So, in that part, the company has two choices. If you develop new technology, first of all, you can share such kind of information as a patent to the whole society. Actually, we can know how to make it, what kind of substance is actually in such kind of drug or something like that. But if you try to use such kind of technology or information itself, at the moment, they have to pay money or something like that. This is the case of the one. 

The second of all, they still have the choice to hinder such kind of information itself to the society because they do not want to share information to the society, even if it deals as a patent. Still, in that society, the company tries to hinder such kind of mechanism or something like that. For example, as my partner already mentioned, such kind of algorithm is actually hindered even in the current situation. In their part of the task, there is no patent at all. As a situation, why such kind of company has a motivation to share information, how to make it those kind of drug itself. In that society, there is no mechanism from the entire government side. That is why, in the first place, they cannot recover such kind of investigation, as my partner already mentioned, or more than that. So, rather, we believe they try to hinder those kind of new technology, the methods to make new products. They try to hinder and just maliciously utilize those kind of methods to earn money. So, that's why we think this is completely problematic. 

Okay, let's move on to the second substantive. So, why we think that stealing the property shouldn't be tolerated even in any circumstances. As my point of information mentioned, even if it is the situation of the worldwide pandemic, even not the situation of the worldwide pandemic, still, we can find a lot of people, a lot of patients, who are actually struggling with any kind of diseases. In that case of urgency, of course, we have to tackle, we have to solve those kind of patients, even if it is not the case of the worldwide pandemic. 

But, unfortunately, they arbitrarily decide a line to distinguish which person should be helped in the case of the worldwide pandemic. We don't think those kinds of situations can be traced. Why is that? Because in our paradigm of this house, existing patterns actually activate new technology or methods in the first place. That is why we think this should be treated as a special thing. 

So, let me compare the two perspectives. First of all, the motivation. Even in the short term or long term, we think our side is outweighed. Because, as my partner already mentioned, even if this is an existing pattern, still, a lot of companies can utilize those kind of methods. More than that, companies have the motivation to recover a lot of investigations. 

But in their paradigm of this house, they try to hinder such kind of information, or more than that, they try to replace other kinds of investigations, not related to such kind of pandemic or crucial diseases in the worldwide. So, lastly, we shouldn't decide arbitrarily what kind of diseases should be solved. So, that's what we have to do.

## Government 3rd
Okay. Thank You chair. We think we find the big contraction from this contradiction from the side of the house because they never explained how to adjust in their counter model. They will adjust the patent or something like that, but how they decide the price or something like that? It's completely unbiased and unclear and that's why we think it's out of this space. It's very big due to theirs. 

Their explanation and the meeting if we think of the so we say we think the motivation itself are that this device the same thing? We think we as my father will tell you there are a lot of alternative incentive for that kind of Cooperation and even if the disincentivization to some extent happen winning is still the benefit I said even if we think feel that the incentive of cooperation will remain and that's why we think the development of Our paradigm explanation is much better. 

Yeah, I'm gonna talk about two issues. Let me talk about motivation. Secondly, let me talk about the principle model. 

Before that, let me talk about rebuttal. So they, the DL, will try to say and why? So they ask them why only during the pandemic or something like that. But let me talk about what is the difference between the normal situation and the pandemic is very clear, right? Because that is a very short time and it suddenly happens, right? We think so in normal situation where we can use, for example, the genetic medicine, for example, can be available and it is a better fight. So in several cases and that's why we have a lot of all parties. But in emergency cases in pandemic cases, we don't have any time to wait to generate, for example. We think because that is especially in the emergency cases, we think we should open a release.

Yeah, let me talk about motivation. They said I think we can share the pattern. So as I put it out their counterfactual is very big in this process, right? Because they said they have the choice corporation still have the choice to hinder or that kind of thing. 

But at the same time, they say that they will force the adjuster according to their model. But we think how if we think of the how they adjust the prices of opening the patent, for example. Yeah, probably they're gonna be the pressurization by the society. For example, Yeah, you should do that because you are the big corporation you owe it. There is kind of CSR or that kind of thing, right? And also probably they will, also if we think of the incentive of the government who will restrict or who will adjust the prices of patent, etc, etc. Probably they will cater to the population, right? If the population or the situation in the society, we think about we need the vaccination because that is very important It should be open or that kind of thing, probably they will cater to the population. That means that even in their patent, probably Yeah, so their argument is completely not mutually exclusive to some extent.

And moreover, we think So And notice that they said, how to say, yeah, yes We have to share but the sharing the information itself means that not only means that you have to share your own information But at the same time you can use other corporation information, right? That brings us the very good argument that my partner tell you, right? Then that real position tries to say that this incentive will happen But they're gonna be still the benefit, right? For example, the reputation is gonna be improved if they can make the first vaccination to the COVID, right? They talk about the case of the Moderna, for example, right? 

So if that is true, even if they do not have the patent to some extent, making the vaccination itself The fact itself is enough fact to prove the power of Moderna, for example, the certain corporations. And that means that Investors anyway have the incentive to do that because they have the power to make such kind of wonderful Vaccination, for example, right? In that kind of moment, we think still they're gonna be the benefit for the corporation.

<POI> With or without pandemic, every single medical product to some extent save life and somehow critical for some people. Do you also think a multiple corporation should release other type of medical patents such as medical medicine for diabetes or cancer? 

It depends, right? Because they Firstly, that is not a mutual exclusive because how they try to deal with that kind of problem is a very unclear process But moreover, we think that they also said adjust, right? It is the same thing So we will we have to think about the benefit of the corporation. But also the situation in society We have to balance that kind of thing If we think of that kind of thing, we think in this pandemic case, we should release that kind of patent.

Then they also try to talk about so that they're not gonna develop and it is very unclear that whether they're gonna be the necessity to that kind of medicine. That's why they're gonna refrain from making it. But because for example, as my partner also told you, because they have the connection with government, right? They are very known about the lobbying, for example in America In that kind of movement, that is the reason why the Japanese government is requiring three times the vaccination in Japan. In that kind of movement, we think they can maintain the necessity of their development. For that kind of thing that means that they still have the incentive to do that. 

And also notice that they are going to be the pressurization by the society, right? Because you dominate a lot of the information, you dominate a lot of the patents, etc, etc. Then they're gonna pressurize you. Why don't you do that?

The conclusion here is even if this incentivization is to some extent true. Still they are going to be the benefit for starting kind of their corporation. And once they make new medicine and release the patent, as my partner told you, there are no restrictions from their side of the house, that's development advance, right? For example, because of the competition within the corporation, right? For example, they try to make the vaccination with lighters, high-definition, that kind of things can easily happen.

Then let me talk about the principle. Firstly, their principle is very general to some extent, right? Because they just talk about how the patent is important. But they never ever explain why that is unique to the pandemic case in the first place, right? 

But moreover, secondly, they're based on the exploit. So moreover, we can mitigate the damage of that kind of things that they try to talk about, because not all patents are going to be released in our paradigm As my partner clearly told you in the model, just that it's related to the COVID or the pandemic cases, right? In that kind of moment, their case, principle case, is also not unique in the first place and not important in this way. So for these reasons, we think that we can, yeah We can, in the pandemic cases, we can save more people in our paradigm. That's why we propose.

## Opposition 3rd
Three things in summation. Firstly, the principal issue, utilitarianism versus the property right, and secondly, the incentive of cooperation in status quo, and thirdly, the incentive of cooperation after plan adoption. 

So let's start. Firstly, in terms of the principle issues, you may agree that the general importance of property rights, which we already explained to you, because the patent right is simply the fruit of investment of research and development of pharmaceutical corporations, and therefore this is guaranteed as a property right. This is nothing different from buying the land or constructing the factory by investing the money. 

We think that there is no difference between physical property rights and intellectual property rights. And actually, in many countries, the patent law explains discreetly that the patent right is one of the property rights. That's why we think this is, in general, this is particularly important. And what we already proven to you in this debate is that this is not acceptable, even in the context of the emergency cases, that this is the deprival of property rights is unacceptable. 

Their only claim is that in emergent cases, this is acceptable. If this is true, for example, if the factory exists, which can produce the vaccine, we can buy this kind of factory regardless of their consent of cooperation and forcibly produce the vaccine. Or if the land exists, in this case, which is suitable for producing the vaccine, that we can forcibly construct the factory and produce the medicine, or that we can forcibly work the doctors or scientists in order to tackle down COVID-19, for example. We think that as long as they fail to explain to what extent the property rights or the rights of the individual, or the rights of the corporation, can be infringed under the name of the arbitrary criteria of emergency, we think their case must fail. Therefore, the general principle of property rights is particularly important. 

And more than that, the arbitrariness of this kind of emergency in terms of focusing on the medical patent is particularly unjust. They mention that in the emergent cases, there is no alternative not to this kind of utilizing patent. Firstly, if you look at even just in Japan, Moderna, Pfizer, KMBIO, Novavax, and so on and so forth, there are lots of alternatives to this. In the worldwide cases, for example, the Chinese vaccine corporation is using alternatives doing this. That's why there is no strong necessity, as they mention that. 

And secondly, in the ordinary cases, if one corporation, for example, invests a wonderful anti-cancer drug, in this case, for the cancer patient, there is no alternative for 20 years, but nothing from this kind of wonderful corporation. Therefore, we think the emergency is not so a constitutional component of this kind of established, trikle down the importance of property rights. Therefore, we see utilitarianism cannot trickle down the property rights. That's why we are very proud to oppose this motion. 

So let's move on. Based on this kind of principle, let's move on to the practical issues in terms of incentive of the corporation in the status quo. There is still a reason why the country, the corporation, have no incentive to spread the vaccine. Firstly, the very simple question is very factual. Actually, in the worldwide, vaccine is spread as a result of the kindness of the corporation. This is very simple proof that their case must fail. 

And on the more logical and debatable level, they mention that this is short-sighted. We think that vaccination is not only the spread in terms of vaccination, it's not only the short-term profit, but also that their KPI includes a reputation risk in terms of their own property, because the ESG is a particularly important criteria in the current investment criteria. Therefore, they are more careful about the reputation risk in the first place. That's why not only the just profit by selling the vaccine, but also the prevalence rate in the population is also the important KPI for the management of the pharmaceutical corporation. Therefore, the analysis of short-sightedness is failed. 

And they also mention that knowledge share will be failed. But if you take a look at the very basic of the patent, because I actually offer the similar patent and I have similar patent after entering chemical corporations. Firstly, after sending the patent to the office, and 1.5 years after, the patent information is opened to all over the world. And after the request of the examination, the patent office examines the newness and technological advancement of the patent, and the patent will be registered. This is the very basic knowledge of the patent. We think that's why after, if the corporation decides to open the patent to get the patent right, their knowledge will be shared. That's why there are some specific features of the corporation that can be shared as worldwide knowledge in our paradigm. We think this is nothing proven in the first place. 

They also mentioned Evergreen. Again, we think that Evergreen is difficult, particularly in a more competitive field, because there is necessity in terms of technological advancement, not only newness. That's why just a similar patent cannot be guaranteed as right, because they reject it as there is no technological advancement, the gap is not technologically advanced. Therefore, their case must fail. 

In terms of the incentive of the corporation, we think this is fine. And in terms of if the corporation has the motivation to build a factory, or ODM the factory, and they sell the vaccine, this is fine. And if licensing is necessary, this is also fine. For those, for two ways of their own production and their licensing, we can guarantee, actually in the status quo, we can guarantee the number of vaccines, the number of drugs, we think this is no problem at all. 

So thirdly, finally, the incentive of the corporation after production. We think the incentive of the corporation ended from two perspectives. Firstly, as the leader of the corporation mentioned, they stopped investing in the research and development, because simply the pharmaceutical corporation's R&D ratio is very, very high. That's why tremendous profit is necessary. But if they possibly sell the patent, at some point of time of the pandemic, this profit is particularly limited. But if they continue, for example, in the half a year, vaccination is recommended in Japan, in this case their benefit will be skyrocketing compared to the selling at a certain time of the pandemic. That's why this kind of incentive comparison is particularly significant for the corporation. 

And if they still continue investing in the R&D situation, if this kind of precedence of possibly selling or possibly buying of the patent exists, in this particular occasion they stop opening that information, they stop registering the patent. Instead of that, they hinder the process as a know-how of their own corporation. This kind of knowledge sharing, as they mentioned, is never ever achieved. Therefore, even if the Italian benefit outside of this area, we are very proud to oppose. Thank you very much for that fine speech. Now on to the reply portion of this debate.

## Opposition 4th
I'm going to talk about two issues with my speaker. Number one, I will deeply examine the practical consequences, which can actually save more people by encouragement of the medical innovation. Second of all, I will look at the principal argument. Is that actually patent as property, right? It can be compromised in this specific occasion, as governments say, or still we need to preserve it. 

So let's move on to the first issue about the practical consequences. So actually, let's move on the important question. That's actually government side of pharmaceutical corporation still have motivation for keep investing the research and development of the medical sphere. So we are saying as an opposition, so patent is critically important to create sustainable money, which can be paid off by their important research development fee. So on this point, government say three things. 

Number one, so opposition stance also kills medical motivations, right? Because we are also, sometimes it's necessary, we also obligatory introduce license system to avoid a dominance and a fee, which is actually adjusted by government side. So what we are saying from position is this stance is the best compromisation to be able to coexist the medical corporation's motivations and also property rights over the patent, right? 

And also, government is actually not decide the unacceptably extremely cheaper price. So government is, of course, to calculate how much is actually acceptable by looking into the cost that pharmaceutical corporation invest on. And of course, they would like to consider the benefit from this patent. That's why the price isn't extremely low and is going to be adjusted. This is the nuance of adjusted price. That's why the still pharmaceutical corporation have massive incentive to keep investing. 

And also they say, even in the consequences without a patent, still this kind of vaccination is needed and demand is high. That's why those corporations still have motivation to keep innovating, right? So, but the price is completely different from just a selling one shot of vaccination or medication, which can be priced as 1,000 yen or something like that, versus the patent, which can be sold 1,000,000 yen to a specific corporation. 

And we think this 1,000,000 yen is a very important price for this kind of pharmaceutical corporation. So to be able to pay off their cost, which is actually very expensive, human risk in hiring important scientists or engineering team or investing in their machine or mathematical model, right? And of course, this kind of 1,000,000 yen or 2,000% of the very seemingly expensive for public people is still accessible if other pharmaceutical corporation has massive incentive to take advantage of the patent, right? 

And other point, they say, that many corporation is going to, other thing we like to say, other corporation is, of course, going to take a free ride, this kind of patent. And this kind of market is going to be certainly red ocean, right? That's why, usually, the free riding is, of course, cheaper in terms of cost of performance. And no other pharmaceutical corporation has the first winner. So that's why, in terms of motivation, unfortunately, their side cannot win. 

So moving on to the principal case. So first of all, unfortunately, they never, ever cut the principal importance of fundamental patent as property right in the first place. And they're just saying this is kind of emergency situation. But things like emergency does not justify every single act to limit the human right and also corporation right, as Takai-san say. That's why, in the case of general principal level, we also win. That's why we shouldn't allow government abusive status. 

## Government 4th
Thank you, Chairperson. They lose this weight for two reasons. 

First, contradictory stance from their side of the house. What we got from their side of the house, like invasion of the property, etc, etc, but on the other hand, they say they are happy to make property be low, to guarantee the accessibility, etc, etc. I don't think to what extent property rights should be respected, because of their contradictory stance. 

Second, they didn't explain under their counterfactual how domination and delay of the research and development can be possible on their side of the house. What we got from their side of the house, well, some venture corporation like Moderna actually succeeded, etc, etc. But what they try to do is just pick up a useful case, a comfortable case for government opposition. To begin with, they didn't explain in any logic how the relatively vulnerable corporation, like the venture corporation, can override the domination by the large corporation, which government side constantly indicated from the very beginning. 

But let's look at their case. What we got from their side of the house is that invasion of the property, right? Like opposition side tried to say, well, government side didn't explain to what extent corporation rights should be compromised, even in emergency cases, etc, etc. But that case, that indication can be set for government side as well, because opposition side, in general, tried to say property rights should be protected, etc, etc. 

But they also didn't explain to what extent patent in emergency case, in this motion, particularly important as well. That's why this claim is not mutually exclusive. Yes, we can see government side didn't do well, but on the other hand, opposition side also didn't do well. Therefore, that cannot be the metric to choose which side we win. And also, their argument are completely example-based to begin with, analogy-based to begin with, because maybe opposition will give us logic, but it's too late. 

And also, I think, but we think the main line from government side is that, well, whether or not this motion, this incentive corporation to commit to research and development, etc, etc. But as we already talked to you, there are, as we already talked to you, this incentivization is likely to happen for several reasons. One, this industry have a huge demand to begin with. 

Second of all, committing this industry will contribute to improving the corporation reputation, because it's directly connecting saving precious life. 

And third, yes, we can see that corporation have to give their own information to public, but on the other hand, that corporation also utilize the information of the other corporation as well. 

That's why disincentivization are less likely to happen, but we didn't hear a stronger refutation from their side. Therefore, we think this motion should be judged in terms of a practical manner, whether or not the profit of the corporation are suddenly devastated by taking this motion to begin with. But government side strongly tell you disincentivization are less likely to happen, and because of this motion, competition and research and development will be faster. As a consequence, we can save the people as much as possible. Therefore, we next vote.
