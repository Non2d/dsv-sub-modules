# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #4 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

# Debate Transcripts
## Government 1st
Being able to say one's opinion is a fundamental right which democratic society must ensure. And this motion is to install a female quota and install female opinions to solve some issues which are exclusive for females.

So let me first explain our model, which is 50-50. So every voter will select one male candidate and also one female candidate in each selection. And the gender is based on one's acknowledgment. It's not necessarily physical gender. So that is our model.

The three analyses for status quo. First, females are oppressed in many occasions, especially in issues exclusive to females, which are neglected and ignored in the status quo. For example, child care. They have exclusive possibilities to raise and give birth to children. There are many harms for females that males may not necessarily understand.

Our second analysis is that stereotypes are lessening the opportunity for women to make discourse. The current system is not a true meritocracy, as many means dominate societies and leaders, especially in parliament. Stereotypes portray males as superior to women.

<POI>If your criteria for implementing a quota is oppression and stereotypes, why not introduce quotas for race and ethnic groups?

Okay, so as a stance, we think it is totally irrelevant to this motion. And other like parliament, it can be installed in another case that female quota is for female issues. And if ethnic problems or such things are so serious, it can be introduced. And yeah, that's the stance.

Back to analysis, there is a so-called meritocracy in the status quo, which is not actual. The idea that females can't have enough ability as males is perpetuating stereotypes, limiting opportunities for women to express themselves.

The third analysis is that there is oppression motivating females to speak up and bring about change. The motion aims to break the unconscious voting based on stereotypes, allowing women to voice their opinions and contribute to societal change.

Now, let me explain the exclusivity of this motion. Two things to say - why other solutions can't solve and why this quota can. In parliament, those who can be candidates can make an opinion and have a chance to change society. The quota ensures exclusive opportunities for women in this crucial role. So, I am so proud to propose.

## Opposition 1st
The reason why I gave race and ethnicity as a reason why we don't implement quotas is because we think the fact that just because a certain group is oppressed and has stereotypes against them is not enough of a just reason to do so. Even if it is enough of a just reason to implement quotas, we say that the harms actually are counterintuitive and counterproductive in the liberalization of these minority groups. I'm very happy to oppose.

What is our stance as an opposition? We say our side has a stance of trying to achieve the issue of gender equality throughout measures that are not female quotas. That looks like things like engaging in targeted recruiting and trying to increase the number of women who are capable of entering elections. We're going to promote women applying for jobs which are very male-oriented, such as getting into STEM fields. We're also going to ensure fair pay and legislative action for paid leave, for instance. We think that those cases can be done by men and don't need a radical change of female quotas which harms and infringes on the principle of equal opportunity.

The reason why this stance is so important but also so mutually exclusive on our house is that our side puts equal opportunity, the most fundamental case of democracy which government tried to say their side was supporting. We say that on our side, we make sure the woman with skills can go up the corporate ladder without any kind of bias, whereas in their world, they're automatically letting women into powerful positions. As a stance, we support different things, so if they try to say that all these kinds of things can be achieved on the government side, we say that's going to automatically mean their stance is contradicting because there's a difference between equal opportunity and affirmative action.

With this in mind, two things come to mind. First, why this is principally unjust and shouldn't be taken in a democratic nation. And secondly, why their side harms women, the very factor they're trying to protect. 

Principly, this is unjust. We say that the principle of competition, regardless of elections, is equal opportunity. That is that we should ensure always that the one who deserves something should always get rewarded. Two reasons why. First is because this is true, even on governmental levels, is because democracy always ensures that people are able to fight on equal grounds. That's the reason why in many, several cases, regardless of race, for instance, the reason why corporates are able to choose, regardless of affirmative action, is because they always want the people with the most skills.

Two, the reason why we think female quotas infringe upon this principle is two reasons. First is because it puts the unworthy in worthy positions. As a premise, we cannot assume that just because a woman means that they are able to represent the values of all women. There's going to be women who respect abortions, for instance, while there's women who don't respect abortion. But even further, the fact that we don't, is that we don't think that something determined as a time of birth should be chosen to decide who's going to be the prime minister or some kind of politician in the first place.

But secondly, this kind of female quotas is something that absolutely discriminates against men, right? You're using a variable that's unchangeable at the time of birth to decide who gets to be in powerful corporate structures. We think that principally this is unjust.

But thirdly, we say this is bad because it fundamentally attacks the principle of democracy, which government was trying to say they were protecting. Why? Because you now have to make voters have to choose, magically choose a female, even if they don't agree with their kind of beliefs. We think that principally voting should be about voting who you want to choose for. We think that at this point, where you have to make voters select one male and one female, for instance, this goes against this kind of principle of equal opportunity.

Secondly, why does this harm women then? Because we say that stigmatization and oppression are going to, it's going to continue. Why is this? Because in the case of having oppression and stereotypes, we think that even if you get these people into the parliament, they're still going to be just acted as a tokenization for instance, right? That they're going to be, these women are going to be treated as if they were just getting there without any kind of power, but just for the sake of filling up the number of females in the parliament. We think at this case, when tokenization is seen in European nations like France or Spain, we think that this is already true and that oppression and stereotypes are not going to disappear. We see it's going to be much worse.

But secondly, we see this harms women because this puts women against only women, right? We think that the fairness should be that women and men have an equal ground of fighting against each other, making sure who has the most skill is able to be achieved. But the problem with this is that you're making women go against women trying to get into the quota, but you're also putting men against men. We think this is unjust, but realize that our side does actually the opposite.

We liberalize and reduce stereotypes for two reasons. First is that we reduce stereotypes by making sure that the most capable people are able to go into politicians by ensuring that there won't be any kind of stereotypes or bias inside these kinds of elections or even in corporate levels. But secondly, we liberalize women because we tell them that they're not being chosen just because of women, but we're choosing them based on their own skill and capability and not a variable determined at the time of birth. We say that our side is much better because we protect the principle of fairness, but also we actually liberalize women, the very factor that government is trying to protect. I'm happy to vote.

## Government 2nd
The leader of the opposition came up and told us it seems to be so equal, seems to be like,  so fair for all the people in the society. However what he meant doesn't mean like,  they are protecting some,  some specific people who are struggling right now.  We say it is especially females who are struggling with their child care but,  but, but like abandoned from the society including, including even like a parallel right.

So in order to,  in order to solve the,  so the most urgent problem right now in the society, we are more than happy to propose this motion. So with that sense i'd like to,   I would like to do two things in my speech: first making some rebuttals to the previous speaker, second, reinforcing the government cases mainly,  mainly about the practical benefit and the exclusive and the exclusivity like I mean like the uniqueness of this motion to take. So let me go first with rebuttals to the previous speaker.

Okay, so they mentioned about we need to ensure that we need to ensure that like equal relationship with for like between the society and,  like in this motion, it is like female like deep, let's say it is like give and take relationship but even in the even in the government paradigm that kind of relationship still existing right now right because even after taking this motion the female candidates have the responsibility to reply to the to what to the female citizens like to the expectancy of the female like a female citizen because there is a female quota those,  those candidates are, are like elected right, so there is a responsibility for these female representatives to do their best to fight against the issue that that is like existing right now for the female.

And second there is also a responsibility for female citizens in general to vote and to make a contribution to the society because there is expectancy from the female quota for these,  for these,  female representatives to do so it must be like,  like important things to incentivize these female citizens to go voting and like to make to create a better society not only for men but but but also for females so that kind of relations still existing right now.

Okay so with that said I'd like to explain first about the practical benefit how this motion can be a solution to reflect the female citizens opinion so we say,  this motion can be a solution mainly by three analysis. First of all female candidates are necessity for the diet or currently right,although our honorable prime minister seems though unlike Mr. Shinzo Abe is highly capable to deal with educational or democratic issue that doesn't that does not mean like they have enough like perspective to,  to care about,  to care about the how these females are in a serious fault right because actually our prime minister do not have children they cannot, they do not, they cannot like make like make,  sympathetic emotion to,  to mothers who,  who are struggling with finding a kindergarten or have to do both working in a child care right?

So in that occasion that these like that there is a necessity of women of women representatives who came up and,  and like, and, and showed up society that showed up diet to,  to what is like,  like, what is, what really isn't necessary for, for these like, for these mothers right

Second analysis like  SMS does not say setting I like an ideal stage for female to express their opinion right although there yes there is a social media for women to express,  to express a political opinion or like how they are struggling and they're successful but there is a, there actually is oppressing situation that does not make solution for how those female people are in a serious situation right

And then like we say this problem is really urgent problem because,  because we have to we have to protect not only women themselves but also the children of these people right as soon like we have to protect these children as soon as possible because  because otherwise because  they will not be able to make  like  um 100 contribution to the society so it is important to protect these  these female people in the society we are more than happy to propose.

## Opposition 2nd
First of all, why is there an election? Because the nation can vote and they select the people and the candidates to live their future. And the candidates, after all, are not skilled. Only the female candidates are valued to join the parliament. So is it an equal opportunity? I don't think so. So I will oppose this motion.

First of all, I will rebut their argument. This is about a stereotype. However, of course, if there is a stereotype, the people and the nation can vote. So it is not a meaning and it is the nation's responsibility.

Second, this is about female's role sharing. However, it is not important. So we can't see the necessity of introducing this motion. So how can females change the situation? It is unclear. We can't see the necessity. So I will oppose this motion.

Next, I will explain my point. So my point is about women. I will explain about women.

In the first place, some of the females don't want this motion. So even if we introduce this motion, some of the cases, some of the burdens will happen. So as the first speaker said, equal opportunity is about skill.

And the second is about women's point. So I will explain two types of women. First point is some of the females don't want to do it. Of course, some of the females will be pleased with this motion. Because they can join our parliament, they can get elected. However, some of the people will be unwilling to join it. Because of the government, the women can't join it. So it depends on the government.

So even if they have a chance to get elected, almost all women don't want to join because of the government's dependence. So almost all people want to appreciate their skill. However, they can't appreciate their skill. So it is very bad for women.

Second point, second target is like maternities or females who don't desire it. So why is it serious? Because they have to join without forcing. So it is a very bad case. How government decides the rate or desire to join in parliament is unclear and irresistible. So forcing if women don't have it.

And after plan, so first target like a skillful woman. Even if it is a woman who is very skillful, it is not a limit like a woman who is very skillful. Women have to do it. It is impossible. So it is a very bad cycle to discuss in parliament. Second target is like they said about women's maternity leave. So they will leave long term. It is bad and the women's image will be decreased if they leave. So I will oppose this motion. Thank you.

## Government 3rd
We say that today's opposition side has a big failure. They never proved that how the situation of the women are going to improve in their side. So we actually think that our side wins because, and principally and practically, because these women are being exploited in society now. We'd like to talk with two things. Firstly, we'd like to do some kind of rebuttals to them. Secondly, we'd like to compare our point with our point, their points, by the principle and practical level.

Alright. So firstly, we'd like to do some rebuttals. Well, right. Well, they said some, well, they say a lot of things. Well, firstly, they said that these kinds of like making some kind of law for women or like other things can be made by these kind of men. But we think that, but we think that the most important thing is that even these people can make these kind of law for the women. Well, some women are actually suffering from these laws. Right. Because it is not their will of having those kinds of laws. They're suffering. So actually, what we think is that principally, we have to make these kind of parliament as a place that each woman and the men are also going to discuss. Their opinion and going to make a better side. You guys ask me what we're going to make, what we want, what we want to make.

And secondly, would they point that these kinds of like, is it isn't it good with some kind of like, for example, racial, racial like quotas that we think that. Well, firstly, we think that we can also introduce these kinds of things that even if it's impossible, we still think that we should introduce these female quotas in the diet. Why is it better? Because these are racial quotas. If we introduce it, what would happen is that we are going to like we think that we're going to introduce with the proportional population rate. This means that they're like the parties that only have like one percent of the quota of the minority ethnicity. We think that these kinds of discriminations will be emphasized in these cases because there's only like one percent and nothing will change. We are going to have a more hard time and we don't want to make it. We don't want to make these kinds of situations in the body, but in the world. 

Well, as a proportionate population, there are mostly like 50 percent of male and 50 percent of women in this body. Because we say that democracy should be in the small, should be like a small nation to discuss for policy and make a better society without these discriminations. We say that because there are an equal number of females and men, we are male. We say that we can make a better, better discussion, better, better policy by doing it.

And moreover, they also say that people should vote for their own will or because it's like a liberal and we can't liberalize women. But actually, we think that the woman is being sacrificed today because we say that people usually win when they vote. They usually see like what kind of experience they have before. If you have like if some politicians are chosen like five times, you're going to you have the high possibility to vote these people rather than the person who had never done these politicians. They ask me why these women are not in politics because women are not that have not been chosen or being sacrificed or being ignored in these elections. We think that these situations are still existing. And to change it, we think that we should give the experiment to these women to change these bodies.

Next, I'd like to go to our comparison of the principle and practical level. All right. So firstly, we'd like to talk about which can work better for democracy principally. Well, firstly, they said that this kind of democracy should be chosen by who you vote or like what party are you going to vote or like that. Then we think that because as we told you, there'd be like democracy. Firstly, it should be a place that you're going to like make a better society by a better society by including the people who are in the country, for example, by using the proportional like proportional rate. Because we say that each of each person should have the right to speak out for it. They ask me why we think that is better. 

Moreover, we think that because women are not being chosen, we say that principally it is actually being a discrimination for the woman. Right. We think that this situation is not being improved. We think that it's harmful. But we thought this is actually why we think that we want a principle level. However, we secondly, we want this to be because we actually told you that how we can improve the society practically, because we say that in today's situation, like child care leave or other situations, it's not improving enough. 

And even you say that something on the SNS, you're going to tell you that you're a Feminazi or like a Twi-Semi or Rati-Semi and you're you're going to be oppressed. Your opinion, if you speak out, they ask me why we say that in order to improve your like status of the social data, for example, like in the in companies or other places, we think that we should introduce these female quotas because they should have better spies on them. Thank you.

## Opposition 3rd
So, we want to rise female status and we want equal opportunity, right? However, this motion contradicts for this purpose and this motion is not practical. And therefore, we are happy to oppose.

So, in my speech, let me compare between our alternatives or our points and this motion. So, from two views. First view is meaning. So, government side complains female candidates will be free from stereotype with this motion. However, this motion contradicts from its purpose because this motion itself represents stereotype. In fact, it looks bad on women. So, let me explain. All this motion is saying is that women can't be elected with the help of this motion. 

Meaning, after this plan, women are elected not because they are skillful or they deserve to be, but because they are women. So, this motion contradicts from its purpose of freeing women from stereotype. And also, our point is superior because we ensure equal relationship based on equal ground as the first speaker said. In our world, women can work against not only women, but also all candidates based on skill. And in addition to that, government side concedes that our side is better because they did not refute this point.

So, let me move on to the second point. Second point is the benefit. So, government side claims that this motion can tackle the current problem of female inequality because there will be more female members of the parliament. However, this won't work. So, let's think why there looks no policy for women in the current situation. So, basically, government side misunderstands the current situation. So, why there looks less policy for women is because citizens as voters do not prefer such policy. So, basically, members of parliament are elected through equal vote including women or white, if any, or all people, right? So, this is the basic of democracy, by the way. So, because people have the right to vote equally based on their opinions, this current situation is not because of some stereotype or the problem government claims but it is because of the opinion of citizens as such. 

<POI>So, if you say that status quo problem is happening due to the small number of female candidates, how opposition paradigm can solve that kind of issue? 

So, even women or feminists have the right to vote and there's equal opportunity for women candidates. So, if we want some policies for women, we can just vote for such candidates. And also, it's not just women who will have such idea or have such policy, but also men can do so. So, there's no need for this motion.

And let me move on. So, also, after this motion, also government assumes that men can't make rational decisions about childcare, as their second speaker says, I recall. This is incorrect because men also have children, right? And they have siblings and families, so they have more than enough incentive to take care of gender issues. So, their argument is meaningless. So, at the end of my speech, let me say that even if you take that they resolve female issues, we shouldn't dismantle the principle of equal opportunity as government conceded. And as we argued, this is what democracy is all about. And we're happy to oppose. Thank you.

## Opposition 4th
Even if we introduce this plan and the form of equality realized, this is not the radical solving for equality. Women never want this making up numbers. What they needed is support.

Today's crash point is, which is the real democracy? We have two crash points. And first crash point is, which is real democracy? And second is, which will be a better society for the woman? 

First, about which is real democracy? They were saying about the women can say one's opinion and also get the seat. And they will be released from oppression. And our point was about forced to choose, which means losing the freedom of choice. Because we have to, every citizen must choose with their real will. And because parliament members represent citizens and politicians who have skill to realize their demand. So, we have to choose with freedom. Choose with freedom is the real democracy. So, we are superior.

And about the second crash point, which will be a better society for the woman? They were saying about women's politician knows women's feelings. So, they can protect their problems. However, our point was about they were, we can never say that they are chosen by their real abilities. And this connects to their harm. Because some women don't want to get chosen because of the making up numbers. 

And also, they will feel pressure because of the government gives them the seat. Because women don't wish this automatic. And also, they are admitting that women are weaker and don't have ability in the society. We can't show that their position is weaker in the society.

On our government failed in addressing how incapable women who become yes men in the parliament can throw out policies better than capable men who have incentive in resolving gender issues. 

On our side, our stance supports women having the opportunity to fight on equal grounds as men through measures like engaging in targeted recruiting or even not revealing genders of politicians, for instance. We reduce stereotypes because they know that women are capable of entering these STEM fields, for instance. And we reduce oppression because only the capable who are independent can make changes. So, who we want to protect is women who want to get admitted by the society with their true skills. And we are saying about that we have to realize the equality by supporting them, like, for example, promoting getting jobs and giving opportunity. 

And the second point was about it gives women harm because it's not their real ability and they can't get out of the pressure. So, for these reasons, we are happy to oppose.

## Government 4th
Two questions in this debate. Firstly, is taking this motion justified? Secondly, is taking this motion beneficial for women? The second question is more important than the first one because in such urgent situations, as the government side has explained, there is no place we made to care about what they call fairness, which was so unclear.

So moving on to the first question. They have, as we have already responded to the democracy argument, I'll concentrate on fairness. As for this point, their idea was that, look, just leaving women and men just the way it is, is fair. So let's just encourage them, which is a fair way. So then they have to prove that in the status quo, women and men are competing on the same ground, which they didn't prove. Because they proved that in the status quo, the election is unfair. Two things. So we told you how stereotype is in everyone. And so how people, so how women won't run for an election. So women are not even on the same ground. 

Secondly, they said that gender cannot be changed. So in elections, we can see profiles, names, photos, and all things are stopping people from fair judge because they are biased. So this beats the analysis on abilities. If they say that people who are capable should be elected, then in the status quo, the capable women are not elected.

So moving on to the second point, which is, is taking this motion beneficial for women? So women are, in the status quo, unfairly imposed on the government. For example, when the government raised consumption tax to 10%, the government didn't raise the tax of daily products, but then they didn't, they did raise the tax of, like, 3D yohin, which is, for women, a daily product. So why did this happen? Because the men couldn't represent the feelings of women exactly. 

At least on our side, we can solve those kinds of problems, which are the serious problems. And if they say that after the plan is not fair, we still believe that the status quo is more unfair because now women are oppressed, but in this society, everyone has to be equal. So before anything, before everything, people have to be equal. That is the premise for everything, including democracy that the opposition side has been talking about. Also, we explain how we can solve inequality through exclusively zero points, by, like, giving a prize to companies that support women.

So overall, they said, like, in practical terms, they talk about backlash or stereotype, but these harms are unclear. So are they going to leave when women live unfair lives? And just concentrate on backlash or stereotypes and images. So we think that at least women might receive backlash, but at least on our side, women can get support from the government. So they can work, for example, by having her husband get childcare leave by the government. So we think that is more good for women. 

So overall, the other side's goal was to protect women, but they just concentrated on stereotypes and didn't concentrate on women's practical needs. Therefore, it is clear that we won.
