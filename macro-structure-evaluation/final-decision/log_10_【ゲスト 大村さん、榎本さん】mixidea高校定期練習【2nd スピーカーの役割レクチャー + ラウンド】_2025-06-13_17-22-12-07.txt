# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #10 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

# Debate Transcripts
## Government 1st
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. We think this motion has the tolerance of the employees' rights, employers' rights to maximize the profit of the corporation, and the employees' right to expand their choice. But we, as a government, prioritize the employees' rights, even if the employees have some damage by this motion.

So three things from the Prime Minister. Firstly, in the status quo, an employee receives harm by the force to come to the corporation in the building. Secondly, in the step-down, the employee can't expand the right-side choice, and the government has to prioritize. And thirdly, the employer's right just to maximize the profit is not prioritized, rather than the employee's right.

Before moving on, I'll explain regarding the policy. Firstly, we think the employer has to make the effort to guarantee the environment to all of the employees to take the telework. For example, if possible, they have to introduce the internet environment, and if possible, they have to make the new chat room in the corporation. But as long as possible, the employer has the right, has the moral obligation to make the new environment to the telework, so that is the stance from our side of the house.

Firstly, the employee receives harm by the force to come to the workplace. In the status quo, many people who have the difficulty to go out, there is a very similar. For example, some people have to care for their parents, and some people have to raise their children. And some other people, they are very difficult to work, to come to this workplace. For example, they are very disabled, and they are very difficult to work, and so they are very difficult to long-distance transfer. So that's why many people, right now, have very difficulty to come to the work. Why is it? 

<POI> So if these employees have to take a look after these parents at home, how can you guarantee that they'll be able to concentrate on their work?

I think also in the special treatment, it's also existing in the status quo. But we think, without admitting all of the employees, also these people have the difficulty. That is also explained by this argumentation. 

So why is this new specialty, sorry, why only some people are admitted, and it's so difficult in these workplaces? Firstly, the other member feels uncomfortable with the special treatment. Sometimes, this colleague thinks they are very subordinate at home, they are very cheating in this workplace. But also, these targeted people are also uncomfortable, because they also know that other people don't have the satisfaction to meet. So that's the reason why, in this special treatment, it's also harm to these people, they have the difficulty to come to these workplaces. That's the reason, I mean, as they're abiding to the protection of all of the employees, this, all of the admission is very important. So that's the reason why we think the norm, the employee come to workplaces is already normalized. So to break up this norm, we think that to admit all of the members is very necessary in the first place.

Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, in the after-plan, they can expand the lifestyle choices. For example, in the after-plan, the reason is very simple, the mother and the father who can't find this kindergarten, and this is a very small number of the kindergarten, basically in the social program. However, in the after-plan, even if they cannot find this kindergarten, also they can, both of the parents can work at home, and at the same time, they can also care about the children. That's the reason why many different and diverse people can equally work at home. Also, sometimes if they live in Shimane, but they want to work in Tokyo, regardless of the birth rate, regardless of the condition, they can get the benefit at the same time in the first place. 

That's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, after taking this policy, what is the sole benefit? Firstly, regardless of people's environment, regardless of their condition, they can fairly work. That's the reason why in the status quo, only the people who are very, very hard person to work with are only unfairly disenfranchised to get the benefit in the first place. That's why to diminish this unfair damage, this policy is very important in this case.

Thirdly, why the employee's right is not so important compared to the employee's right. Opposition might say the employer also has the right to make a maximized profit, and without a maximized profit, also it gets harm to this employer. That's why this employer's right is also important. But we think, as long as possible, the employer has to prioritize the employee's right. 

The reason is very simple. Firstly, the employee is very weaker than this employer, so they can't resist against this employer, because if they are against the employer, they have also the possibility to be fired by this employer. That's the reason why, even there are some difficulties, this employee can't resist against this employer. That's why, as a moral duty, this employer has to protect this weaker position in the first place. 

Secondly, this employer doesn't get the harm so huge, because the reason is very simple. Also, by this policy, this employer has the chance to hire many diverse people, even in the theater and graduate in Harvard, even in this workplace in Shimane. That's why, ladies and gentlemen, also, if we can expand the admission, this employer also has the possibility to get the benefit. That's the reason why, as long as this employee also has the chance to benefit, this employer's right is not so important in the first place. 

Thirdly, also, society already admits to protect the weaker position, even if the employer has the harm. For example, in the society, also, this society holds to the cooperation to hire the disabled people. Of course, if we can hire some percentage of the disabled people, this maximizes our profit. Unfortunately, it's not so achievable in the first place. 

But, ladies and gentlemen, this workplace is very important to live. Without this workplace, many people can't live in the first place. That's the reason why, in order to protect all members of the society, this society already admits to the employer's harm in the first place. That's the reason why, in this policy, it's also applicable to protect the minority people so we get the support.

## Opposition 1st
I will talk about two issues in my speech. Firstly, I will talk about why forcing all employees to be in office is critically important in certain instances in order to maximize productivity. Secondly, I will talk about why the corporations, in general, have the right to force employees to act in a certain way. But before that, I will give a response to the House.

Firstly, they generally talk about the interests of the employees. Firstly, we are not going to oppose a voluntary implementation of work from home by the employer in the first place. If the employer feels it's necessary or it fits the current trend, the employer will voluntarily do so. And recently, those kinds of corporations are actually increasing, especially in the current outbreak of COVID-19. So we think that candidates of those kinds of job hunting have a certain choice to move to another company if there is a dire necessity to work from home. 

But secondly, in special instances, for example, the mother or father who has to take care of the child all day, or maybe the disabled person, we think in this kind of exceptional case, the states are already enforcing certain welfare for the employees in the first place. For example, the companies have to allow the employees to take care of the elderly, or the company has to hire disabled people. So we think in that kind of instances, the companies probably have a voluntary incentive to allow those disabled employees to work from home if there is a dire necessity. But we think that forcing all employees to work from home is damaging for some instances, which I'll explain later. 

Secondly, they talk about, well, this is also beneficial for the employees as well. Once again, we are not going to oppose voluntary allowance of these work from home. So we don't think it's an issue in today's debate.

<POI>Under special treatment, for example, in parental leave, the other employee doesn't regard them as the same employee. Also, this norm is also harmful to these people. Why is it so justifiable? 

Well, we don't think this is going to be a huge stigma in the first place. The mandate of child care leave or maternity leave is already spreading in society. And also, the mandate of hiring disabled people, or those kinds of norms, is generally spread in Western democracy. We don't think it's a huge deal in today's debate.

So on to the first issue, why forcing all employees to be in office is in certain instances critically important. So we have the three-level analysis as to why being in office is critically important for increasing productivity or efficiency or speed. Firstly, we think that transparency so that employers are able to check whether the employees are effectively working is quite important. Because if an individual works from home, for example, they can be distracted because of their children. Maybe they talk to them, or maybe they have to talk to their families, and so forth. They may not be able to be focused on the work all the time and all the day.

And also, there are certain communication barriers that are going to increase. Because if, for example, two employees are in the office, they are able to cooperate.

Thirdly, we think that in terms of security, being in the office is critically important. Because if individuals are allowed to work from home, maybe their information in the personal computer may be seen by their families or their friends. Or maybe, for example, if people are able to work from home, they can work at a cafe or outside their home. In that kind of instances, there's a certain possibility those kinds of information may be revealed to the member other than the corporation employees. But we think that for these reasons, the productivity or efficiency or speed may decrease.

And the government might say, well, this efficiency or productivity is marginal. But we don't think it's marginal. We think in certain instances, this lack of efficiency or a bit of delay of the work is critically damaging for the corporation. Because oftentimes, these corporations have to conduct their working in a limited time. For example, in case of the insurance industry, usually March or December is the renewal period. And during that limited period, these kind of workers have to do a lot of work. They have a lot of tons of negotiations. They have to prepare for a lot of presentation or paper material so that they are able to negotiate. And one delay or one day delay or one hour delay may lead to a decrease of the profit, decrease of the premium from those kind of companies. Or in case of tech companies, for example, that people have to repair the error or bugs in the system. We see, for example, this is a finance system, that the one day or one hour delay of repairing those kind of bugs lead to the massive loss for the company or massive loss of trust from the customers. We think this is going to be damaging for the company in certain instances. 

Therefore, that these kind of corporations are more likely to not allow, no thank you, to employees to work from home. And we think that being in the office and doing the work as efficient as possible is extremely necessary. Therefore, we think that corporations have to do so.

Secondly, the corporation right, right? So, generally, corporations have the right to limit the employees' choice. In other words, they require employees to act in a certain way. Because the fact that the corporation are imposing the working, meaning that the corporation are already depriving their work, their time in the first place. Or if necessary, for example, the corporation are able to require getting certain qualification in case of the accountants are actually in accordance with the need for the work. Or in case of the teacher, teacher cannot express political opinion during the school, whatever, so forth, because it's required as a job, right? So, in accordance with the job, that corporation are able to limit the action of the employee in a certain way, right? 

And we think this applies to this motion as well. Because, as I said, that being in the office and increasing the efficiency is critically important in some way, right? 

And we think the only exception we have that the corporation are not able to do so is that there is a dire need in the first place. For example, in case of child care leaving, like requirement of having disabled employees. Or maybe that, for example, the corporation have to, corporation, like, there's a certain limit on the working times. We agree to that. 

But we think that as long as corporation are fulfilling those kind of minimum level of the requirement by the government, we think that it's immoral for the government to require even further. Because those kind of efficiency is extremely and critically important for the corporation's sustenance, for the stakeholders as well. Therefore, we beg to oppose.

## Government 2nd
Because employers are at the top of the company, we believe that their salary is high and their social status is stable. Because of this, we believe that, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. Their salaries are low compared to their employers, and their social status is unstable, and they are easily fired by the company when the company faces depression. And we believe that, at this point, the most vulnerable actor in this debate is that employee. And we believe that that's why we have to force all companies to allow their employees to work from home. And that's why we have to take this plan.

So, first of all, let me rebut the first argument. So, they talked about the productivity will decrease because of the work in the home. So, we have three rebuts here. First rebut is about the employees' benefits. As our first speaker told you, this plan is giving employees more options. And because of this, more employees can work in the company. For example, people who live in Shimane can also work in Tokyo. And not only people in Japan, but also people in a foreign country can also have a large capability of working. The company can also hire these kinds of people if we take this plan. And it will be easier for them to hire these kinds of people. So, first of all, again, there is some benefit for the employers. 

And the second rebut is about the productivity. So, they said that productivity will decrease. However, in the 21st century, we believe that most of the work is done by facing the PC. So, the desk work is prioritized in the company. So, we believe that these kinds of work can also be done in the home. Although they are in the home. Because they also have enough facility in their home. 

And the third rebut is that even if it decreases the productivity of the company, we believe that the government has the right to force employers to accept these kinds of damage to some extent. For example, as our first speaker told you about giving example of that company has to hire disabled people to some extent. So, we believe that even if it decreases the productivity, it should be allowed.

So, let me talk about three things in my speech. 

<POI>So, the world you're envisioning is where you're going to have teachers. You're going to have all these employees working at home. How can you guarantee all these security issues are going to be resolved under your house? 

So, we believe that the security issue of this debate, security can also be well done in our paradigm. Because we believe that in taking after this plan, we believe that almost all companies will have the environment for providing these kinds of facilities. And we believe that these kinds of home working will be much more done in our paradigm. We believe that much more technique will be developed in our paradigm. So, we believe that these kinds of security problems can be solved in our paradigm.

So, let me talk about who should we save in this debate. So, who is the most vulnerable actor in this debate? So, this is the employee. First, the point is that employees are more sensitive. Let me talk about the employers. They are top of the company. Their salary is high and their social status is stable. So, they will not be damaged by some minor change. And they only face difficulty when the company has a huge debt. And these kinds of things are much less possibility. 

And compared to employers, on the other hand, employees, they are just one of the components of the company. So, their salaries are low and their social status is unstable. Because they are easily fired by the company when they face this depression. So, we believe that at this point, employees are more sensitive. And because of this, they are the most vulnerable actor in this debate. 

The second point is why do we have to protect the most vulnerable actor? Why do the employers have the duty to protect these kinds of things? This is because the employers get benefits from the employees. So, they have the duty to protect all of the employees. And especially have to protect workers, vulnerable workers. For example, like people who have to raise their children. Who have to care of their parents. Who have difficulty in commuting because they are disabled. They have handicaps. And these kinds of people will be most harmed without help. So, we have to save these kinds of people. 

And for example, like in Japan. As I told you, there is a law that employees should hire some number of disabled employees. And so, we believe that in this reason, we have to protect most vulnerable employees. And that's why we have to take this plan.

And let me talk about why forcing all employees is important. So, first of all, this is because it is difficult for employees to say out when there are some exceptions. So, employees have less power than the employers. So, it's difficult for the employees to say that I would like to work in their home because of their childcare. And we believe that in this point, we have to force all of them not to make these kinds of victims. Thank you.

## Opposition 2nd
I will explain our first argument, the importance of variation in the space of people's lives. I will explain the merit of employees and how to go to the companies. In the first place, if a lot of employees don't go to the company, there is no reason to go to the office. It is a very serious point. As the first speaker told you about communication, if an employee wants to do a meeting, they can't do it smoothly because their house is built out of bad reasons. I will explain later. Also, the employee can't correspond quickly to work at home. I will explain this reason.

First of all, I will explain in the case of employees. Why is it important to go to the company? Because they can limit the quality of life of the company. This reason is that employees can separate their time to their life and working time. The company is a very important space to work. 

However, after taking this motion, bad things will happen. First, some employees will neglect their work for some reason. First reason is that they can't concentrate on their work. For example, if there are a lot of young children at home, they will cry. They want to pray for their parents. It is very serious because the father or the parents can't do their work or can't do the meeting. Also, the case of women is very serious. Of course, women want to take care of their children. However, if working from home is okay, women have to take care of their children. It is impossible to concentrate on their work. 

The first reason is that the company may take a guarantee. For example, a set of nursery or maternity leave. It is important to concentrate on their work. The company can get profit. 

The second reason is that the relaxed time will disappear. The company presses their work out of work. It is very serious because employees will be impressed with the amount of work at home. It is very serious because the family time will disappear. They can't relax in their home. Variations of people's life will disappear. I will explain the second reason.

The second reason is that the company has to make a profit. Employees can regulate their private time. Go to the company's merit. Employees can see the amount of work. They can prevent overwork. However, after taking this plan, employees can't see the amount of work. Employees will have a lot of tasks. It is very serious for the situation. 

The second reason is that productivity will decrease. As I told you, the concentration will decrease. The quality of life will decrease. It is very serious to spend life. It is very serious for not only the employees but also the company and employers. Employees are confused about their private life. If we take this motion. Therefore, I oppose this motion. Thank you.

## Government 3rd
The most problematic issue surrounding employees is that the employers just seek for profit and only have a narrow point of vision based on their old-fashioned working experience and aren't realizing the true benefits given by the work at home, the telework. That's actually why we're going to say that we should allow all employees to work at home. 

Firstly, we'd like to do two things. Firstly, we'd like to do rebuttals. Secondly, we'd like to compare their point and our point.

They said that there is some kind of discommunication problem. You cannot tell other people that you want to do some kind of work or other things. But firstly, if it's that kind of situation, we think that we should introduce this kind of telework to all people. Because if you are the least person who is only doing telework, it's very hard to tell other people that you want to do something at home. For example, I want to take care of our parents at home. It's very hard to say. Because of this, it is very harmful for the individuals because individuals cannot choose these kinds of things. 

But secondly, even if they can take this kind of work at home, it's very hard to say. Because it's what one person is going to do at home and other people are working at the office. It's very hard for the individuals to say, please help our work. We think that it's very impossible. So we don't think that this kind of thing is good. 

But rather, we think that these kinds of problems can also be solved by the telework. Because even when you're doing telework, we have Discord, Skype, Twitter, or other kinds of things, which we can tell other people, please help my work. We think that we can do these kinds of things, even in telework. Why didn't they contribute? We think that these things are enough. 

Secondly, about the maternity leave or other things, we actually told you that these things, even these kinds of maternity leave or welfare, maybe they're spreading a little. But if we're doing these things voluntarily, it is not spreading worldwide or nationwide. Only a few, only a small number of companies are doing this. And it is not being the fundamental solution. That's actually why we're going to say that all employees should be allowed to do telework. Because we want to liberalize all people by forcing it. And the companies will have the incentive to introduce these kinds of things. And it's going to make or develop these kinds of services.

Thirdly, about the security check. All right, well, we don't think that this is very relevant to this motion because we're talking about if it's related to technical impossibility or not. But firstly, we're just talking about technically possible or if it's technically possible or not. And we think that because of this, this is not important. 

But secondly, we say that even if you are in your company, these things are still leaking. We think that there is no difference between these kind of two. But surely, we say that if you're going to have telework and all employees are going to do it, other kind of security companies or other companies will have the incentive for you to make a new kind of security application. And we think that these kind of security can be solved by in this situation, such as these kind of working places. We think that it's going to be equal in these kind of things. We don't think it's a necessary point.

And fourthly, they say that some people neglect their work because they cannot concentrate on their work. Well, firstly, this is a very stigmatized case, right? We say that even if you are at home, you can have some kind of concentration. 

And secondly, even if you cannot concentrate on their work, we think that these people will be fired. But if you are at home and you're going to do telework, you do your best in order to maximize your profit and not to be fired like that. And we think that because of this, the housewives or other disabled people can work at home and do their best too. 

Fifthly, they say that they cannot relax at home or QOL will decrease. Why would this happen? We say that we're going to restrain long-time work or other things. If you're going to have more various lifestyles and if you can't have private and also work, even in telework, you can't have your private time. Because if you cut Skype or other kinds of working things, you can have your own private time. No, thank you. We think that is very important. And moreover, we think that QOL will increase because you're going to have more various lifestyles. This is why we're going to be liberalized from these small workplaces to old-fashioned workplaces or other things.

We're going to compare our points and their points. Firstly, we'd like to compare whether working at home physically and psychologically is possible or not can be the criteria of not allowing work at home of employees. Always, they say that the most important thing is to protect the productivity of the company or other things. But firstly, this is old-fashioned thinking. We don't see the truth. If we're going to introduce, we think that this can be done. But firstly, we don't think that this kind of productivity can be prioritized than the individual's working style or other things. Because we say that because of this old-fashioned thinking, the individuals cannot have the right to choose this kind of work at home. 

And because of this, the disabled people, the housewives with babies or other people cannot work. And these people, the human resources are being corrupted in these cases. If we can introduce these people, we think that we can have more productivity. We can produce more things. And this can enrich these things. 

But secondly, we think that even if it's going to have some kind of harm to this productivity, we think that the vulnerable people in society should be protected. Because the government or other people have the moral duty to do this, the moral obligation. 

Secondly, we'd like to say that we can benefit more on the employees and more in competitive markets. We say that in the future, we have to introduce this kind of work. And because we're going to introduce these things, we think that these companies can enrich their market too. That's actually what we're going to say. We should take this motion. Thank you.

## Opposition 3rd
I think the world they envision is a world that is divided by digital lines. I think it is a world of social isolation, where employees face external job issues, but also internal home issues at the same time. 

I would argue that the biggest strategic mistake of the government was that they were going to force these employees to work at home. The funny thing is, they claimed that employees were vulnerable, but it seemed to me that at the moment in which they introduced this forcible plan, I think it's pretty clear to say they're going to be exploiting them more.

I'm going to be looking at this debate in two metrics. First, I'm going to be looking at employee benefits, and secondly, I'm going to be talking about company benefits, given the context of both speeches.

Let's first look at employee benefits. I'm going to be talking about two things here. Let's look at the argument of a birth lottery, and you could just work anywhere. They came up here and just stuck to this example of you can hire graduates of Harvard working at a company in Shikimane. First, I don't know how realistic that example is. 

I think that's a pretty minor case, but let's say that's a very prominent issue and that we need to actually look at this. I think the issue is that there was no process. I will stress that the biggest issue is that there's probably going to be no central institution because everyone's going to be working at home. What this means is that there's going to be things like online interviews, online meetings, and the issue is this, is that there's no transparency, right? Just because you're a graduate from Harvard doesn't mean they're necessarily capable or that they're capable of doing everything without any kind of mystique. 

I think that there are issues like miscommunication when you work at home, that I think these kind of miscommunication and just an increase of procrastination are a lot of things that are very viable. I think that the comparison we need to make is that when you're together and you're able to talk together and you're able to monitor each other to see if they're doing the correct thing, we think that's going to be much better. Therefore, we think that the issue about having graduates from Harvard isn't something so necessary

But I will argue that even if it was so important, I think it's possible on our side because if a multinational company, I think it's possible to have a lot of companies in different places. So the talk about Tokyo and Shimane is also achievable on our side. I think the talk about different companies around the world is also an issue that is very resolvable on our side. Therefore, I think this talk about birth lottery is something that's rather much better on our side.

Secondly, let's talk about the quality of life. The context they gave was that, hey, have to look after children or hey, that these children have to look after their elderly because they're weak. Given that this is a debate about all employers forcing all employees to work at home, I think they also needed to defend the cases where they didn't have anything. They didn't have any kind of children. They didn't have any parents living with them. I still, given this context, I don't think there's any just reason to forcibly make people stay at home and work there where there could be a lot of security issues, a lot of miscommunication and force these people to stay at home. 

But let's say, and let's look at these contexts of having children and grandpa. There's two issues. First is that they say that you could concentrate at home, but I don't think you could really concentrate with a crying baby in the background. I think you're going to be rather focused. I don't think that having your own internal issues at home, but also job issues is necessarily a good thing.

But we agree that this argument, this rebuttal isn't enough to resolve this certain issue of, well, having these elderly or having children. And I think that the biggest thing that I want to stress and the thing that government whip never addressed was that these problems like women's issue, like unequal pay, no maternity leave is not a problem of employers not allowing their employees to work from home. I think it is an issue of employers not taking any active and sustainable measures to ensure a sustainable environment. Therefore, I think that what we could do on our side is to make sure that there's going to be maternity leave, make sure there's going to be a sustainable environment, make sure that people don't have to suffer when they go from home and make sure that they have enough opportunities to look after their parents or children. 

The government whip only refuted this by saying that, hey, this is only happening a little in the current status quo. Then, hey, if that's the issue, then we will mandate it, right? We don't think that it's necessary to just make it voluntary on our side. We're happy to reinforce these kinds of articles and laws. Therefore, I think in the general quality of life, our side is going to be much better because you don't blur the line between work and life.

Anyway, miscommunication happens in the workplace. Why does this extend to become a reason to oppose emotional? I'll talk about that in my next point about companies, and I'm going to involve that in the story about security. There's two points to look at company benefits, and I think it's first, security, and second, productivity and profit overall. 

First, let's look at security. I think this is a very important point because these kinds of miscommunications, these kinds of information processing, and the privacy is literally what is able to maintain a company's life. That is the information of a new product or consumer data is something that is really important, and I think it wasn't simply enough for government whip to say, hey, it wasn't so important.

They said that, hey, it happens on our side, but I think that the biggest issue is that it's going to happen more on their side because I think the security breaches and hacking is a very urgent issue that has to be ultimately resulted where people are able to simultaneously work together in a working environment and try to combat that issue.

The problem is, on their side, you're going to have people perhaps sleeping at different times, and if you're going to be living in different time zones, you won't be able to simultaneously deal with these kinds of things or miscommunications, which could potentially lead to different products and different types of chaos. I think that when you're separated, you're not going to be able to face these issues much better unless you're going to be in this cooperative environment. Therefore, upon security, I think it's a big issue, and I think it's something that's going to be worse on their side. 

Lastly, let's look at productivity very simply. They said that, hey, if people don't concentrate, you can fire them. The issue is twofold. First is that it's going to be hard to see if they're concentrating in the first place. That's why it's going to be extremely hard to regulate this.

But second, it's not easy for the company to fire people because they're literally the companions of a company. I think if every employee is procrastinating, you can't fire everyone. Therefore, upon productivity, we see it's going to be much worse on their side. 

We think there's going to be security breaches, miscommunication, and a lot of overall breaches of employers' rights. I think that ultimately, all their benefits can be obtained on our side. Therefore, we think we should win this way. I'm very happy.

## Opposition 4th
Two Clarifications. Firstly, we are fine that if it is in the interest of the employers, they are voluntarily going to do so. And the current rise of these trends is actually increasing, meaning that there are other companies that are able to allow the employees to work from home. 

Secondly, they talked about what employees generally have the right. That's a general idea. We agree that to a certain extent, employees have a right, but employers also have a right to a certain extent. This is a matter of extent; therefore, we have to assess the pragmatic consequences as to why or whether this policy is uniquely beneficial or harmful for each actor.

Moving on to the first issue - the interest of the employees. The problem with their case is that many of their problem depictions were not uniquely relevant to the motion. They expected the problem of the child raising issue or disabled people or the stress due to the working. We think those kinds of things are already measured by countermeasures such as the mandate of childcare leave or the mandate of hiring disabled people. Also, the annual aggregate working hour is quite limited by the law. 

We think those kinds of countermeasures are already seen in the status quo, and they didn't really explain why a blanket allowance is necessary.

The deal we already told you, and which was unresponded by the government side, is that it can be worse for the employees, this policy, because there's a boundary between working and private life that is going to diminish under their house. We think that if these employees feel pressured by the corporations to work well, as they characterize, probably they're always thinking about working during breakfast, for example, during dinnertime or immediately before sleeping. They may be pressured to start to open the computer and start to work. We think that this is a thing that currently many employees are actually claiming in the status quo.

Therefore, the conclusion here is that the benefit or interest of the employers they describe can be better in certain instances, but it can be worse in other instances. They didn't really explain why holistically overall, the likelihood of the employer being better off is quite high in the first place. 

Also, of course, we already told you that the interest of the employers or the company is quite urgent. They say it's marginal, but we think this marginal one day, one hour delay can be critical.

Further, we already told you that the communication barrier is going to decrease, people can be distracted by childcare, or people can't do private tasks while working or maybe those kinds of so forth. We think due to that, their work may delay one day, one hour, or maybe weeks. We think those kinds of marginal time differences are critical when it comes to the tech company like fighting against the finance, errors, or bugs in systems, or maybe that if companies have to negotiate with the customers and the business partners in the limited time. 

Also, there's a certain security concern, irrespective of the technology, that the risk of the information being seen by other people is going to increase. This is crucially problematic.

Lastly, the overall comparison. What this is, as I already told you, that got failed to explain or depict in the picture why this policy is uniquely necessary, other than any other measures in the first place. We already told you that we agree that this time and efficiency or the speed may be marginal, but this marginal difference is quite critical for the corporation productivity in certain instances. 

We think that this policy is the override invasion or too much invasion of the corporate autonomy and rights. This policy is unjust.

## Government 4th
So why we have to force all employers to allow their employees to do the work. So first of all, we are not forcing all employers to like employers to work in telework. 

So and why we have to force all employers to allow employees to do telework two reasons here is that the first reason is that it is difficult for an employee to claim when they are not all allowed. So only one employer has less power, and it's difficult for them to say that they want to do telework. Although all other employees are working in a company, they will be feared to be fired by the company, and they cannot say such a thing, and they will have a problem in the care of their parents or care of their children or in the commuting. 

And the second point is that, first of all, now there are little numbers of companies which allow telework. And we believe that in this point, we have to force all employers to allow their employees to work in their home because without these kinds of things without these kinds of things that which forces all almost all companies will not allow them to work in their home.

What was our proposal? What was our proposition goal? Proposition goal was that giving more opportunities for people to work, for example, like people who have to care parents or children. And this impact is big because these kinds of people will be face difficulty in finance if they cannot work. We, the government side of proposition side, are giving these kinds of people the opportunity to do work, even though, although even they have some say how they have some how they have to care their parents or children. And why did and what was the opposition side thinks? The opposition side was about productivity.

So what was our refutation? First about this communication. So today, there is no need to we do have no there's no need to communicate face by face. For example, like we gave the example of email or line or Twitter. This communication will not will not occur and will will not occur in these kinds of paradigms. 

And second about the security issue. First of all, we think that these kinds of things are out of the debate because it means that it is technically technically impossible to secure these kinds of security. However, even if it is in this debate, we believe that the security company will have the huge incentive to develop the technique, and they will do it will be realized that they have no security issue until work. 

A second about the mutual exclusivity about the employees' benefit; they said that employers' employees' benefit quality of life will decrease because of the telework. However, this is not exclude this is not unique to our this is not unique because they these kinds of employees can only have to choose to work in the company, not in the telework.

So let me have the comparison. So first comparison is that we should be safe. So the comparison is that we should be safe. So we believe that the most vulnerable actor in this debate was the employee because employers are tough. They are the top top of the company. They have high salary. They will not be damaged by minor change. 

On the other hand, employees, they are weak. So they they can they will face difficulty in finance if they cannot work for these kinds of people. This issue, this plan is vital for themselves. So we believe that we have to save these kinds of vulnerable actors in this debate. 

And we also believe that it's also the employer's duty to save these kinds of vulnerable workers. And it's too selfish to, like, get only the benefit from the employees, like, hiring only like, which seems to be benefit for themselves. So we believe that it's also the employer's duty to save these kinds of vulnerable actors as long as they get the benefit from the employees. Thank you.
