Reasoning:

1. **Direct References**: Throughout the debate, both teams consistently referred to each other's arguments directly. For example, the Opposition 2nd explicitly pointed out that the Government's definition excluded poor people but didn't address disabled individuals, thus critiquing the Government's model.

2. **Specific Engagement**: The Government responded to the Opposition's concern about the plan not being equitable (e.g., not taxing disabled people), clarifying exclusions in their model. Opposition 1st and 2nd extensively discussed the Government's rationale and provided their counter plan addressing the aging society problem, highlighting areas of disagreement with the Government's approach.

3. **Direct Refutation**: The Government 2nd speaker rebutted the Opposition's claim that their counter plan would solve the issues similarly by emphasizing the process and impact of not having children on the economy and care systems.

4. **Building/Extending**: The Government reinforced their initial arguments by addressing the Opposition's counter plan, arguing it was vague and lacked a clear process. They elaborated on how tax revenue from their plan could fund welfare, contradicting the Opposition's claim of inefficiencies.

5. **Reiteration and Addressing Counterpoints**: Both sides continued to address each other’s main arguments about societal responsibility and individual freedom regarding childbearing, trying to dismantle each other's proposals by scrutinizing the implications of the plan and counter plan thoroughly.

These examples demonstrate consistent and meaningful engagement between both teams throughout the debate, thus justifying the "Agree" rating for interactive argumentation.

# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #13 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

# Debate Transcripts
## Government 1st
We believe that every single person in a nation has the responsibility to contribute to society, to contribute to the country itself, and to take actions that lead to a better future of their country. Therefore, we believe that it is justifiable to take this motion to solve the issues that we are facing right now. So our model is to put a tax on those people who do not have children, and this amount of tax will be constant and equal to everyone. However, we are going to exclude those people who do not have any children due to their economic reasons. Those people who cannot afford another family member and have decided to not create any children, we are not going to put a tax on those people.

I am going to talk about mainly two things. First, why ageing society is bad and why we need to solve this problem. Second, why taking this motion is going to be effective to solve the problem that we are facing.

First of all, as we all know, many developed countries are facing ageing society right now, including Japan. For a super ageing country, the future is unmeasurable dull, incredibly fragile, and filled with uncertainty. In the case of Japan, the children in the present days, which I mean by teens and maybe people in the 20s, are an incredibly lower number compared to those people who are in their 50s or 60s or 40s. When those people in their 50s or around those ages reach to 70s and 80s, the people in their teens and 20s right now are going to be forced to take care of them.

Those young, the youngsters in the present days, will be forced to manage the economics and earn money and pay tax to the government in order to secure the pension for those elderly. Because these young people who are going to have the responsibility for taking care of those elderly in the future are small in number compared to the people in their 50s right now, those young have to have the huge burden to support a bigger number of people compared to them. This burden will significantly be severe when comparing to the people in the same position right now.

Because the government will have to get money, the government will be going to put a heavier tax on those people. They will be going to force a bigger portion of tax. When this happens, those young will be going to lose their incentive to work hard because they know that their money will be taken away largely by the government. They will be able to use those money according to their own will. They will start to work just to get the minimum amount of money that they can live. When this happens, the economy will be deactivated and stigmatized. Obviously, the money that will be spent on the elderly will get smaller. Not only those elderly, but the social welfare that is granted to every single person in the nation, those social welfare will be poor in quality, especially to those people who are in agony of poverty. In their lives, social welfare is playing a big part in their lives.

When social welfare becomes smaller or worse, those people will not be able to get support from the government. Those people will suffer even more. Also, those people who suffer in their poverty will increase compared to now. We do not want that nightmare. However, if we do not solve this ageing society problem, we will be forced to face that reality, and we will be forced to regret our past beings that we should have done something to prevent that nightmare that they were forced to face. We do not want that. There is an urgent need to solve this problem.

Next, I will talk about why this is going to be effective. Because no one will be eager to pay tax, incentives to make children will increase. Before explaining this process, I would like to first categorize the people who do not have children into three types.

One is that those who are very poor and cannot afford children, and second is that those people who despise children and strongly believe that they do not want any children, and third is those people who are in between, who are thinking of having children, but they are not that desperate to have children, so they decided to not make any children.

For the people in the first category, because the tax will not be targeted to those people, it is totally okay for them because they do not need to pay tax, or they do not even need to create children in order to avoid the tax. For the second people, who strongly believe that they do not want any children, they will be forced to pay tax. However, as I said in the beginning and will be explained in my subsequent speakers, they always have the responsibility to contribute to the future of society, so they, and because they made the choice not to make any children, they have to fulfill their role to the society, and it is okay for them to make, it is okay for the government to make them pay the tax. And for the third category, those people who are in between, because they don't want any tax, but they are also okay with having children, their incentive to create children will increase.

So those people, which we believe that is the majority of the parents who do not have any children, because those people's incentive to create children will increase, the number of children will obviously increase, and therefore will be able to solve or kind of make the issue better. So for this reason, we propose. Thank you.

## Opposition 1st
We also think that super aging society is so serious now for Japan and our goal is to improve aging society and to make social that people have to end willingly. But we oppose this motion because this motion is not a unique way to achieve this goal.

First, so now first I'm going to talk about taking this motion isn't equal for every people and second is there is another counter plan and the third argument is this is free for individuals free.

First argument is taking this motion isn't equal for people. And now there are a lot of people who can't have children even if they want to have like disabled people and like injured people to get injured people. So those people are if those people want to have children but they can't do that. So to impose an additional tax on these people is not equal and this is not unique for those people. So as the definition we said we won't impose tax for people who have disabled people or who have a disease that can't make children. So that this is this is not our argument but but in this case, there is another counter plan like that to make a system that women can have children more easily and more little anxiety.

So now why women tend to not have children in these days? So this is because of the lack of money to bring up their child and anxiety for concerning for their job like being dismissed and like that. So now the woman has a lot of concerning for having a child. And so in this case in this society, there are another like that taking more authority maternity leave for women and to make more kind for women to make more kind society and thinking away for women.

And so if we if if we take this counter plan there is an effect there is a two effective effective. First, it's easy to have children and the second is the men's men's heart feeling is more like is lighter than now. So first is easy to having children. So if we take if we take this counter plan women can feel more women can feel easier than now for about having a child. So women can give can have children more than now. And the second is which is better for women like first is having children by stressing from government or second is willing to having a child. Of course, the second willing to having a child is more better society for every for women and so women and their partner.

So if we take this motion people who want people if we take this motion is not unique and is not the only way to solve the aging society. So there's another big counterpart. And this is more this is more this is a little harm than than this motion because if we take this motion people who want to have to win now lose losing losing money lose money and then they can't have to win. So this motion isn't unique to achieve this goal.

And the third argument is this is individuals free. So to take to have children or not is it one's free. But there so the details you explain the our second speaker. So for these reasons, I think we should oppose this motion.

## Government 2nd
Not having children costs for society. Having children, it doesn't mean just only having children in a family. They're creating workers, future laborers. And we don't have children, it means they don't create a new generation, who will be future laborers, who will support future society, who will care elders. So we need to take this motion. 

My argument is why not having children doesn't fulfill responsibility, and they will fulfill responsibility by taking this motion. Before that, let me have rebuttals. 

So today's opposition side, the problem given from opposition side was not the big issue, because we will not impose a tax for the poor, or people who can't have kids just because of their environment, for example, they don't have money. 

And also, they gave the alternative that we believe our plan is better, but because first of all, they didn't explain the process.

So my argument is why not having children doesn't fulfill responsibility, sorry, sorry not, and they will fulfill the responsibility. So I'm going to have three points. Firstly, I'm going to analyze the children, and secondly, how it does harm for society if they don't have children, and thirdly, how the situation will be solved. 

So firstly, I'm going to analyze the children. They're not just a part of the happiness, but they're future citizens, which means they will make an economical movement, which means they make and keep the country's economic alive and healthy, which is worth for almost all citizens. For example, they can get jobs easily, they can buy things easily, like that, and so it's worth for almost all citizens. And moreover, they are future workers. If they work for online jobs, or like in a factory as scientists, they can develop skills or economics, and they will provide things for our society. So they are contributing for society, each other, like that. And it contains nursing the elders, because they need to, who need to nurse the elders is that those citizens who are not child, but they will be adults. So we need those children. 

The impact of this argument is that, first of all, that those children are very important for our society who we need, or if they don't create those, then they are giving harm to society, which they are not fulfilling their responsibility, which means they should take the responsibility somehow to fulfill the responsibility.

And the next point is that how it does harm for society by not having children. So what is the responsibility to create a new generation is that, let's see, for example, in Japan, many people need to quit the job to care for the elders, and the point, otherwise, those older points, nursing, and those oldest. Why? Because in an aging society, those elders are increasing, and they are hard to go into nursing, nursing houses like that. And those children who are those families have to care for the point, all those, so they need to quit the job. 

And in that case, they can, they are able to use welfare systems, and if the government points, those people will cost for the society by using those welfare points. So the impact of this point is that not having children does very harm for society, which in terms they are causing harm to others, they should take this responsibility, even if they don't have the freedom to escape from the responsibility, it is justifiable.

Finally, the third point, how the situation will be solved. By imposing the tax, those taxes will be used, will be used for welfare services, for example, nursing, the nursing can be high-tech, which helps youngers, like using IT programmings, or like that, and more, they can have more financial support for nursing, which helps the youngers to care, to nurse those elders. 

So in conclusion, what I told you in my speech is that having, having, not having kids, causing harm to our society, which means they need to fulfill the responsibility to contribute to our society, as my first speaker told you, and today's opposition side, those points, are those issues not big enough to reject this motion.

## Opposition 2nd
So, in the first place, we want to strongly say that PM only said at the definition that they except for the poor but no disabled people and those who have some disease. So, this means that disabled people and patients who have diseases have to pay money even if they have that.

Moving on to the rebuttal and reconstruction. So, first of all, they said that people who think that couples who want to bear children or don't have to bear babies can raise their babies if this motion is taken. But, think about if, in the first place, women who want to have children and have to bear babies with their strong feelings, they must not bear under the forcing. Because if they do that, they would have a burden to raise their babies, right? Because of the additional tax. So, if some of them don't want to pay additional tax and bear babies, they have no strong feeling to raise them. And some of them would abandon babies. And this case will occur.

Moving on to their arguments about future citizens. So, this can be also achieved in the Opposition side, right? Because our side has come to a plan that also achieves raising many babies. So, this can be also achieved on the Opposition side, too. Like children will improve technology also and improve society. And our side thinks that children are important, too. Because we already share the goal that achieves having many babies in the aging society. So, however, our side, we have a counter plan. And this is much better. Because this can happen. No additional tax to pay by one part of the citizen.

Moving on to the arguments of caring elders. So, this also in government's after plan. Elders are existed much as Opposition side. So, people have to take care of them. Also, not only in the government side and also Opposition side. But Opposition side, we can support money to them. And their arguments are all shared with our side. 

So, I would like to talk about our counter plan. And say that our counter plan is better than taking this measure. So, our counter plan was to increase the children. As the first leader of Opposition has just explained. And this can be easy for their children. Because of this environment that women can raise their babies or bear their babies easily. And they have spiritual marriage that they have no forced choice. And have freedom on the government side. 

So, we have planned that by two processes. First of all, it is to urge maternity leave or making a kindergarten. Or something like a facility that children can play there all day. And more, so that women can work comfortably. And secondly, it is to support money if women raise their babies. So, this counter plan doesn't have to pay an additional tax on people without children. Because people who raise their babies can get money. And also, as I said before, that people who are caring elders can get support from the government by giving money. So, we think that this is very effective in the super-aging society.

So, our third argument was the evangelical right. For example, people who don't want to marry or people who don't want to raise their babies. So, our example is that people who don't want to marry, especially the man. So, taking the motions mean that if the people who don't want to pay tax. They have to get married and bear their babies. And raise their children and pay a lot of money. And children have to get better education. And they have many orders to raise their babies. So, this is very unjustified between these people.

So, for these reasons, we would like to oppose. Thank you.

## Opposition 3rd
I would like to actually thank the government side for clarifying why we actually need to increase the number of babies in this current society. But the problem that they lack, what they actually needed to do in this debate is to provide a fundamental reason why exactly taking this motion is the most effective way and the most efficient way to actually achieve this goal in this whole debate. But they totally failed in talking about this. They only talked about the benefits.

And on the other hand, we've provided a better model that actually attacks the core problem of why these issues are currently happening, even in the first place. And I would like to further expand on that. 

I would like to talk about mainly two issues in my speech. First of all, which side can effectively solve the solution better? And secondly, which side can actually provide a better society for our future citizens?

Okay, so next, first, moving on to my first point, which side can effectively solve the solution better? Like, in the PM speech of the government side, the PM actually gave three characters of the people who cannot, who do not have babies. And we believe that this is actually true. First of all, the people who are extremely poor. Secondly, the people who don't want to have children in the first place. And third, the people who can but they just don't want, for several reasons. We think that this is actually true. But the problem here is that the first two characters here are totally not mutually exclusive. And on the other side, they will still not have babies. So what I'm trying to say here is that the most important actor, the vast majority of the actors in this debate, stakeholders in this debate, is the people who can but just don't want, just don't have babies for several reasons.

I would like to clearly explain why they do not, why do they not exactly have babies in the current situation and why, by taking our counter plan, they will actually actively try to make more babies and actually tackle the whole goal in the first place. So the reason why the people, the reason why these people in the first place do not have babies is because I think there are mainly two reasons. First of all, they only have an average income. They're not extremely poor, but they just only have an average income. And they're really worried that they cannot fully support their children, cannot provide an extreme or enough amount of education to their children, even if they have them. And secondly, the people who are just worried about their own career, their own future themselves. But the government side totally mischaracterized or even failed to even characterize these kinds of people in the first place. So I think we already win this debate by clearly clarifying them.

And secondly, why we can actually achieve this, why these people will actually actively have more children in the future is because, first of all, just as our first speaker and second speaker have clearly mentioned, we're going to provide more maternity leave and even actually support these people in the first place. So like even if they only have an average income, because we will support them financially, they'll also be able to have more babies or even try to have more babies because they actually receive those kinds of financial support. And secondly, the people worried about their career, their future, because we'll provide them more maternity leave or other kinds of options, they will definitely try to make more babies by taking this plan.

Secondly, the second issue of today's debate, which will provide a better future for our citizens. So I would like to mainly put a focus on two actors. First of all, the people who are actually their parents in the first place. And secondly, their children. 

First of all, what will happen to the parents? Just as an explanation, people who have only the average income are worried if they can fully support their children. Because these people are just literally forced to have children just because they just want to get away from these taxes or even maybe forced by the whole social norm in the first place. They're basically forcing their own lives into a very endangered situation where they do not have enough money, they do not have enough support. 

Because their parents are even in a financial crisis, literally. They'll be forced into a low-quality life, not enough education, and those kinds of stuff. And we believe that these people, like the government itself is sort of failing their parents and their children in itself. And we believe that this will keep on going, but people keep on going for generations and generations. This will never stop. It actually worsened this problem in the first place.

So we believe for all these reasons, we totally take this debate out of the government. Thank you.

## Government 3rd
So there were two questions in this debate, first was about people's choice of kids versus society's benefit, and we think that our plan will provide benefits for millions of people in the future and for the new generations to come. We also explained how not taking this motion will definitely lead to gradual corruption of society, and not taking this motion will be a threat for countless people in the future and we must think about the long-term effect.

The opposite side was saying that when the number of people increase suddenly, it will be hard for people to do nursing, and we think that is exactly true, however, we explained that our plan will not make people in the future harder to nurse old people because the additional tax will be used on welfare, and so that more people will be willing to work in facilities for the elderly, and they will also be used for schools, such as kindergarten, and so this does the same thing as their counter plan.

As for the second clash, was about our plans, and they talked about creating a great environment for women, and we had three points about this. 

First, their counter plan was very vague, and they didn't provide enough process as to how their counter plan will lead to solving super aging society. Second, even if their plan did work, even if we think that our plan would work faster, it would be much more efficient, and we emphasize the efficiency of our plan. Third, by having additional tax, it will be much easier to create a great environment for women, and we think that with the status quo, their plan is not realistic at all because it's hard to get money, and money doesn't just come out of nowhere, and we don't understand how they are going to pursue their goals.

And the opposition side was really focused on having people not wanting to have babies, and not wanting to pay tax at the same time, and we think that our plan will provide a great environment for mothers, as we said, using our additional tax, and we think that because parents' environment will be suitable, abandoned babies won't be a problem at all

And moreover, if some people, like the opposition side said, if some people have such a strong will to not have babies, if they truly resent children, then they would definitely choose to pay tax to avoid having children, and so their best case about not having tests, and not having babies, and does not stand. 

And when people start having more babies, there will naturally be more people who will start having children, and with that, it will naturally, the society will try to adjust to that, and their environment will be much better, so our plan is much faster.
