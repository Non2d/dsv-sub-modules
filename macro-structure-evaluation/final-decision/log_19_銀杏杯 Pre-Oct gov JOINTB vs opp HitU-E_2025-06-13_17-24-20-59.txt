# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #19 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence

- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Government 1st
Well, the children in the module, they have the right to decide, but there is a big problem about their life in the future. So, thank you ladies and gentlemen in this house. It is an honor for me to be here and deliver this speech in here.

So, today, I have three points today. One is that, sorry, I have one today. It is about the choice for the children. And, before we move on to my point, let me define this notion. So, the young children means that there are very little treatment, for example, that all kinds of the elementary school or kindergarten students have to offer to the young. So, and this medical treatment is a very suspected medical treatment. If we deny this treatment, maybe children will die.

So, let me move on to my point. It is about children's choice. So, fundamentally, we have the right to choose our life. So, the decision of where to live, where to belong, and so on. So, these kinds of issues about our life, we have the right to decide them. However, actually, these young children are so immature. They cannot understand how significant that issue is. So, instead of that, parents can choose their children. 

However, on this point, the most important thing is that, what parents can choose is limited to only reversible choices. Because, even though at that point, children are immature and cannot understand how significant each choice is, but after they grow up and understand the importance of each choice, they should have the right to live to these kinds of choices. Because, the life of the children is of the children themselves. So, the parents can, instead of choice by the parents, should be only temporary and reversible.

However, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, it is a very suspected problem. Because, if we deny the birth of children, maybe children will die. So, even that, on children, the chance to be chosen will forever be lost. Even that, so children cannot be chosen in the future. So, it means we are depriving the very fundamental and important life, which is relevant to our life, from the children. So, it is very problematic.

So, in the first place, why we should have the right to choose for our life? Because, the most effective actor who understands our own love is needless to say, we are all. So that, I can understand my favorite, but I cannot understand your favorite, like this. So, we cannot understand completely each other. So, in order to be happy, in order to choose most enjoyable choice, we should by ourselves. 

And also, we government should admit it's right. Because, children is also the important individual in this nation. And actually, at that point, children is a very immature existence. And the opposition, I am going to say that, because they are immature. The parents have the right to choose for them. However, ladies and gentlemen, please remind this point.

So, this immature children will act in the future and be a very strong existence, very intellectual existence. They potentially have the ability to choose. And, this potential choice means that, we apply the right to choose from the individual. So, then why this choice is so important?

So, I will give an example. For example, we get name from the parents and it's really relevant to our love. Because, we use this name many years in whole life. However, if we do not favorite our own name or we suffer from this name, we can change it if we become the adult. It is also one of the potential right that admitted to the children. 

Religion is same. Because, actually, religion is very important part that contains the individual's life. So, it certainly changes the individual's life. Maybe, it brings children to be happy, however, it sometimes causes unhappiness. So, children should have the right to choose religion. However, in the future, when they understand what religion is, how severe, how important, how good, how vicious that religion is. So, defining that potential and important right from the children should not be admitted by the government.

## Opposition 1st
Today, I want to protest to the children in the religious community. And the religion is very important for believers, and religion has changed their identity and their living community. And keep religious teaching and law is very important because they can devote to the good in the world. By keeping the religious good, they can live comfortably in society and mentality.

We strongly believe that children are immature, so parents can make more better decision for children. Not only the aspect of medical care, but also living their children's life. 

So I have two arguments. Firstly, in the status quo, such believers have a choice to be, to decide which medical care should be taken. And this is very good for them. And secondly, after taking this plan, they cannot decide to medical care, and they suffer from the fear of guilty. And they can make a living in the religious society.

Let's move, before moving on to my first argument. Refutation to the government side is included in my argument. So firstly, under the status quo, they can can decide what is good for children of believers. They can decide which medical care is best for the children, so this is very good for them, and good for children's life. Because parents love their children very much, so they can make parents very familiar with the religion. So they know how serious situation they are in.

And parents also know how serious situation a child is in, whether it's an illness or injury. So they can decide which medical care is best. Which is more important for children's future. So parents can make a decision for children. And comparing those two, and of course, parents want to save children's lives, so they make an effort to touch another medical care, which is not relevant for their just rule. So only a few cases, few medical care is not good. They cannot, so it is okay to deny medical treatment to their children, or they're just wrong.

So let's move on to my second argument. After taking this prompt, parents cannot decide their children's medical care. So it's very harmful for their children and their family, because broke religious rule is very serious program for them because they devote to the good for a long time to keep the religious rule, so they feel the guiltiness, and they feel they will be betrayed. So they feel very guilty, and it is very miserable life for them.

And their community is very important for them, and their relationship is very, very strong. So as a community member, that family broke the religious rule, and that family is very bad for us. And they betray them, and they come to ignore them, or they don't make them to go to church and so on.

So their family living, if children live to buy medical care, however, they will be living a very, very hard life. So it's a very serious program, so we strongly oppose this motion.

## Government 2nd
So the opposition said, as if children will not change the religion, as if parents have the right to choose and decide the children's religion in all their children's lives, but it's not true. Parents do not have the right to choose the children's religion forever, just temporary religion. So children have the possibility to change their religion.

Firstly, let me introduce my previous speaker. Firstly, she said that religious people will feel guilty because of the medical treatment, but it's not true, because religious people can justify post-medical care. They will think if the children have the medical care, the government forced us to take medical treatment, so we are not against our religion. So they can justify their medical treatment, and the other people in the community of this religion will not think so badly of this.

And also, she said about the possibility of children's blaimed, but if the children are blaimed by the other student or other children, the government can or school can save them. For example, the blaimed children will ask the school teacher of other religion, irrelevant to the community of the religion, so the teacher will think it is a problem, and can segregate the children from the community temporarily, and can move to solve the blaim.

Even if there is a possibility of the feeling of guilty or being, but it is not more important than the children's forever right to choose their religion. Because, as my partner told you, children have the potential right to choose their religion, change their religion, and if children are killed in their little, defend their little, children will lose their right forever. So we government must protect the children's right to choose their religion.

And second, she said parents can decide because parents love their children and understand their children. But it's not true. We human beings are not about ourselves, mostly us, so we must decide about ourselves. 

So let me give you more arguments. Why is it so bad that children do not have body autonomies? As my partner told you, little children are immature in this consensus, and so to some extent, and could be possible extent, parents can decide when they are very little, for example, name of what they wear, and so on, because it is reversible in the future. But this is irreversible. We cannot bring the dead back. So children will lose their right to choose their religion forever.

So why is it so bad? I think it is a consensus, religion is important, religion is a very fundamental part of our life, but the opposition side only considers the parental religious issues and so on. But children are also affected by the religion greatly, and the way of thinking, the children's way of thinking might be different from the religion's thinking. They can change their religion when they grow up. 

So children's right to choose their religion must be given to children, because unless we decide things ourselves, we cannot be happy. What is happy for me, I know the best. So if we don't have the choice, we cannot live freely as adults. It is a very unhappy thing, and children will die just bacause of parent's madness.

Children are not slaves, children are not dolls, children are not means of parental religion. Children have the right to choose their religion, and children have the right not to be a parent's religion, to be a god.

<POI> We strongly believe that only living for all values is not an absolute value, because for example, there are a lot of things that are generally acceptable, so we don't believe that only living is so absolute, not an absolute value. How do you think about that? 

I don't talk about only living. Living has a possibility to change your life. Without living, we cannot sing, we cannot change our way of thinking, we cannot change our religion. So if we live, we have the possibility and certainly possibility to change our way of thinking. 

So let me compare the importance again. The feeling of guilt or blame is reversible, and in some way, as I thought, we can solve the problem, but this is irreversible. As my partner and I have told again and again, we cannot bring the dead back, so living has a possibility to change our way of thinking, so we must say that this life could change our lives.

## Opposition 2nd
So today, we recognize this debate is about which right is more prioritized, child's right or parental right in this situation. So, we strongly believe that the parental right should be prioritized for these children. So, why we can say so, I will explain it. 

So, in my speech, I would like to make three points. First, why these people believe in religion and belong to the community. First, for these people, believing in religion is so important in terms of their life. And secondly, how serious are these children after being taken from death. And thirdly, comparing the bottom side in terms of children in the future.

So, before moving to my point, let me repeat what the government said. The government said that children can change their religion. But this is not true. Because firstly, the dogma is very different from other religions. So, they cannot easily change their religion. And also, these children live in this community when they were born. And they are taking the religious education. So, most of these children believe in this religion. So, concerning this fact, even if these children change their religion, they can't feel comfortable and more serious situation.

Second expectation, the government case is so unlikely. Because we strongly believe that if this situation is not related to the religious cases, of course, our parents allow the doctors to carry out the treatment. So, the situation that goes against religion is few, which these parents and other doctors conflict with each other's statement. So, the possibility of the government cases are so small.

So, please let me move to my first point. Why for these people believe in religion and belong to the community, believe in religion is so important in terms of their life? Because the religion is only after to give them mental stability. So, if these people strongly believe that if they obey the dogma, we can save their mental stability even after they die. So, however bad situation occurs to us, we can be saved after death. And that belief supports their life. 

But on the other hand, if they don't obey these dogmas, they feel they cannot be saved by these gods. So, that is very mental harm. Why? Because in the future, they will despair their future. For example, the people in poverty are suffering from this poverty because they have no food and no clothing. But other people who are suffering from the relationship, for example, they are isolated from other friends and are bruised by their classmates. But these people, they betray against the dogma, they feel that if they... forever we cannot be saved. So, no way to help them save. So, in the first case, they kill themselves. But so, we strongly believe this belief is so important.

And how seriousness will occur is emotional. So, as my partner said, the community, these children will be isolated from this community because the community member ignores their children because they feel that children betray their dogmas. So, if these children go to the school, other children don't talk about with them. And also, the children can't go to the church because they are afraid of criticizing themselves. And also, they feel that living is so hard and so pity. And at last, they feel that it is okay that I die in that situation. So, for this reason, we strongly oppose this motion. Thank you for listening.

## Opposition 3rd
I would like to compare which side is better for religious families and religious children, particularly for children born into religious families. 

So, I have two key points. Firstly, the parents have the right to decide children's medical care, especially when the child is very, very young. Secondly, I would like to compare the government's stance in the state of school and the time after taking this motion.

Firstly, the government has argued that if the children die, they have no right forever and no possibility forever. However, this is a very small case. As the government has acknowledged, children are immature and cannot judge what is better for their entire lives. 

On the other hand, parents have a deep understanding of religion, love their children immensely, and can make informed choices for their well-being. This enables parents to compare what is better for the children's future, whether it involves taking medical care that goes against religious laws or foregoing medical care that is detrimental to their religious beliefs. 

The government's suggestion that it is possible for children to change their religion is deemed unrealistic. Children are influenced by religious education from a very young age, and as they grow up in the religious community, their ability to make independent choices may be limited.

Now, let's move on to the second consideration. After taking this motion, families become very harmful in terms of mentality and living in the religious community. This harm is primarily attributed to the guilt they feel. So we strongly oppose this motion.

## Government 3rd
So today, our positions are mainly focused on the people, the children, who will certainly follow their religion. Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to point out that there are also children who follow and not follow. And we also want to protect non-following children. And also, it is very important in the children's group, in the child's group, and also, we want to make sure that as long as we are living, we can deal with something useful, something that is relevant.

We have the possibility to change the situation. However, we dare. We are inspired. We dare. We certainly know that all possibilities. We have a 1,000% possibility to change the situation. It's observable. 

And also, there is a misunderstanding. So they said "government just wants to prolong your life", but this is not true. We want to protect the future life of children. Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to point out. So our first point is wrong. So parents are right. Can it decide children's whole life? The answer is no. So we want to save the children's life. It means that we want to let the children, children's future life to choose.

And because fundamentally, we need to save the life to be admitted, and in the child's group, the two problems occur as I said. 

So one is that who will be for that reason and who will not be for the reason? We do not clarify in the child's group in that unexpected situation. So in that situation, so in that situation, parents cannot decide that, parents cannot decide that never reverse the choice. Because it will certainly raise that precious opportunity to re-choose, it means that re-construct our own life for children. 

However, they explain that parents can decide it. Because, so after children follow their religion, so they will certainly, they will certainly sacrifice. But, but they just focus on the children who follow their, follow their religion. And they completely forget that children who won't be following their religion.

And also, as I said, as long as we are living, we can change the situation. We have the possibility. However, we feel that, no, it's very significant. So, on this point that significance is that we can be superior than our opposition in terms of the significance of possibility. 

Also, they never explain that. In that situation, why, why parents can choose such a severe decision that is related to their children's whole life, forever. So there's no explanation for why we cannot, we cannot understand this point that what they say is very vague.

And also, the second point is that, so they merely talk about how important the relationship is. Yes, it's so very important. It's very important. That's why we should choose on our own. Such, such kind of, so very important life map that should be chosen by children themselves. Because, because the children's life is not their parent's one. We have our own life, our own time. So, we have to protect that, our children's future choice, not only life. So, following that, we are happy to be here.
