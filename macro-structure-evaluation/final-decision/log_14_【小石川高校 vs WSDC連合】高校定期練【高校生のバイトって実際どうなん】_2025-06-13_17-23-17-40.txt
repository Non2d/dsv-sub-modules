# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #14 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

## Government 1st
The school days are a really crucial period in our lives. During that period, high schoolers should experience as many things as possible. That's why we are happy to propose.

So, in the first place, let me define this motion. So we, the government side, follow the current law for part-time workers by which we allow students to work for no more than 10 hours a week. We set these hours because high schoolers should spend a certain amount of time on studying, not only part-time jobs. And also, if they extend these hours to the late night, there might be more dangerous jobs, more dangerous part-time jobs for high schoolers. So we fought to prevent those dangerous jobs. And for the first reason, we set these hours.

So, first of all, let me tell you what part-time job brings about for high schoolers. So, I'm going to talk about one thing. This is experience of society and working. Let's take an example of doing a part-time job in a family restaurant. There, we can interact with people of various ages. For example, from people of high schoolers and people of 30 years old and people of 60 years old. So, there are a lot of ages in having a restaurant.

And by interacting with those people, interacting with those people is not experience that high schoolers can get in high school. This is because in high school, there is almost... High schoolers interact with only people of the same age, right? And even if they interact with people of different age, this is like one year older or one year younger. Students don't that much, that often interact with teachers. By doing part-time job, they can experience of society and working, in which there are a lot of people of various ages from young to old.

So, how is this? How is experience of society and working good for high schoolers? So, let me divide high schoolers into two groups. First, high schoolers who will go to college after graduation. So, for those people, doing part-time job can broaden their interest and know what they are suitable for and what they are not suitable for before college. This is really good for high schoolers because in college, they will do what they are interested in or what they want to do or something that is good for their future. By experiencing part-time job before college, in which they do what they are interested in, they can know what they should do in college or what is good for them before college. So, they can learn and they can do better things in college. The second group is people who will not go to college.

<POI>How does washing dishes at Saizeriya benefit people who want to be, for instance, scientists or soccer players? 

I think people who want to be soccer players don't do part-time job in Saizeriya or come to restaurants like that. Because if they want to be a professional soccer player, they should practice. There is no need for them to do part-time job in Saizeriya.

So, now let me move back on to my argument. So, I'm going to talk about how is this good for high schoolers who will not go to college. So, for those people, doing experience part-time job is still good too. So, this is because they can experience society in advance. So, for example, if they start part-time job from the first year of their high school life, they can experience society for three years before being exposed to society, before the graduation.

This is really good for high schoolers who will not go to college because if they are not going to college, after graduation, they will just go to society and start working. So, by experiencing society in advance, they can learn what to do in society or how to interact with people in society. So, that means letting high schoolers doing part-time job during their high school days means that there will be much more time for preparation for society. So, this is also good for students who will not go to college. So, in conclusion, part-time gives high schoolers a lot of benefits for the future. As I mentioned, that's why we, the government, are happy to propose. Thank you.

## Opposition 1st
Panels, what you have to recognize in this debate is that part-time jobs that are available for high schoolers are not advanced. It's not like an internship that is available for university students. You don't acquire any knowledge. You don't acquire any particular skill that is going to widen your future choices. And it's just you're going to probably be exploited. You're going to be you're going to have to dish like wash dishes in Siberia. That's the kind of experience that you're going to have. It's not going to be in any way valuable for high school students. Therefore, we think that high school is better if high school students never experience part-time jobs during their school days.

Now, two things to talk about. Firstly, I'm going to talk about why part-time job is uniquely harmful. Secondly, I'm going to talk about, in comparison to other alternatives, why part-time job is particularly worse on comparative. But just before we go on, just what are our stances and clarification? And then I move on to rebuttals to the side government.

Now, what are our stances and clarification? We support academic and club activities of high schoolers. We don't support part-time jobs. And furthermore, we also think that the context of this debate needs to be probably about a developed nation.

Given that the majority of high school students who are from poor households in developing nations probably cannot afford school in the first place, probably are working full-time jobs, you know, as child labor or whatever. And furthermore, we think that this debate, I think the government would probably concede, should genuinely be about which side can provide better outcomes for high school students in the future, whether or not to experience this sort of part-time job or not to experience this.

And the premise of our arguments is going to be that, I think the government is probably going to agree with me, that once you experience part-time job, you're likely to be encouraged to do so later, or you're going to be trapped in the cycle of working as a part-time job. Because the reason being that the fact that you get money, the fact that you get slightly economic independence from your parents is likely to attract many high schoolers and they're likely to prioritize the part-time job over school or over the club activities. We think that's a very likely situation that once you experience this, you're going to continuously work in a part-time job.

Now, what then? So let's move on to the response to the side of government. What we heard from the government side, firstly, we heard that, you know, high school students should interact with people from different ages because in high school, you only interact with people from the same age. Firstly, the existence of teachers and parents are the counterexamples of this. 

But secondly, we told you that like when you are in club activity, you would probably like carefully use, you know, respectful word which is keigo to your senpai or you would behave like in a way that you would behave yourself in front of your kohai and that sort of thing. You can still learn what you do in your communicative skill and social skill, even in the framework of school. 

Then we heard that they're going to widen the perspective in the future. No, it's not. They fundamentally mischaracterize what part-time job is going to be.

Now, let's move on to the first point. Why part-time job is uniquely harmful. There are two things to talk about. First is that the part-time job is probably going to be manual labor in the vast majority of cases, like dish, like washing dish in restaurants, in McDonald's, that sort of thing. Because those sorts of jobs do not provide any knowledge, do not provide any actual experience that is going to be valuable in the long run. And they might talk about like internships, for instance, but in the majority of cases, like as for internships, the sphere of choice is extremely narrow because not many corporations offer internships to high school students, even though it's available in the vast majority of cases only and exclusively for university students. 

But secondly, no thank you, is that they're likely to be exploited under the cheap wage because they're just high schoolers, right? They're not from any elite university. They're just high schoolers who are kids, right? So they're likely to work in really, really cheap wage. So we think that it's uniquely harmful.

Second point, in comparison to alternative, why part-time is bad. Now, there are two kinds of skills that I think matter in consideration of the future choices that children are going to have. One is communicative skill and two is academic skill. We think both are equally important, like when it comes to expanding the future of children as much as possible.

Now, firstly, as for communicative skill, we think that it can be acquired through club activities, for instance, within the framework of school activities like you do, like you do debating, you do basketball, you do baseball, you do soccer, that sort of thing. Firstly, you're going to be able to learn how to interact with others, how to interact with your senior, with your junior. But secondly, like you're able to find what is fun for you, right? The fact that I was able to find my hobby, which is debating, has expanded my future opportunity in a great way, right? Now, I'm able to interact with these great, great people who are online right now, right?

Now, secondly, as for academic skill, we think it's important to note that in developed nations, there's a prevailing norm that going to university is the prerequisite for your success. That is to say, when you apply for a job, you have to graduate from an elite university in order to expand the choice that you have in the first place. If you have a job that you want to apply for, you need to have graduated from an elite university. That's why we think that in high school, it's particularly important for you to go to a summer program in Tetsuryokukai, which is a cram school for students who want to go to the University of Tokyo, instead of wasting your time, like washing dishes in McDonald's.

But furthermore, the unique benefits that come in high school is that high school is a precious time, right? It's only three years. And in university, we say that there's not much like club activities, for instance. And we think that's why we provided the unique benefits that come with not experiencing and by experiencing other alternatives that are available for students. For all these reasons, we proudly propose.

## Government 2nd
Club activities are completely different from part time jobs in that students should behave in a responsible way. If you do such a rude thing for the customer, you will be fired. At this point, we believe that the part-time job is completely different from club activities, which they can gain. And we believe that high school students should also have the time to do part-time jobs. And that's why we strongly believe this motion.

So, let me rebut the arguments first. So, the first argument is about the cheap wage. They said that because of the part-time jobs, they are accepting high school students. The wage will be so much cheap and it will be quite uniquely harmful for high school students. However, we don't think so that the wage is cheap for the high school students. As long as they are high school students, we believe that the money got by the part-time job will be enough for themselves to use things.

For example, they are not going to use money for their living. For example, like to buy a house or to pay the money for the house or to pay money for water, electricity. These kinds of things can be done by their parents, but they can use the money for the things which they like to do. For example, tapioca or soccer tools or something like that. So, we believe that this is not the cheap wage and it will be uniquely harmful for high school students.

And the second point is about the students' future. So, they said that communication skill and academic skill are both important. And we completely believe that. We also agree that these both two skills are important. And they said that for the academic skill, they said that they have to graduate from an elite university. And because of this, they believe that they have to go to the Kyokai Ojuku.

However, this is completely against the first thing that they also think that club activity is important. We believe that we can use the time spent for club activity. We can spend the time used for club activity for the part-time job. So, we believe that there will be not so much big difference for the time used different from the club activity.

<POI> So, are you implying that putting on fake smiles at McDonald's is much better than interacting and having fun with your friends? 

So, we believe that we do not have to completely diminish the time for club activity. We can decrease the time used for club activity to some extent. And we can use the rest of them for the club activity. And we can use some time for the part-time job. No, thank you.

So, then let me talk about the club activity. So, they said that interacting with people is the one thing. And interacting with people is the important thing. And it can be also done for the club activity. However, we believe that all the things done in the high school students, students have no responsibility to interact with others. So, they are not forced to talk in a polite way for their seniors.

However, in the part-time jobs, they have to act in a polite way. So, they have to act in a polite way. And they can act with a lot of people. For example, from people like high school students to people seniors, for example, 60 years old, something like that. We believe that in this situation, we can much better learn about the communication skills. And the point that they have the responsibility and they can interact with many people.

Then, let me talk about our second argument. Our second argument is that set the fundamental sense for using money. So, what is high school students? So, when you are a high school student, it is easier for them to use their money for what they like. For example, tapioca, games, perfume, for traveling. All these kinds of things are much more easier than when they are in junior high school or elementary school.

The second point is that they will use a considerable amount of money compared to junior high school or elementary school. For example, they get money 5,000 yen a month or 6,000 yen a month. The amount of money will become bigger and bigger. And we believe that when they are in the high school student period, they use a considerable amount of money.

The third thing is about why it cannot be done when university students. So, this is because when they are university students, parents cannot control the usage of the money they gain. So, on the other hand, when they are high school students, they are under the control of parents. No, thank you. Parents can control the usage of the money to some extent.

Parents can teach the important things, can teach the way how to use money. For example, when they are using all the money they gain from part-time jobs, using for games, only for games, and do not deposit some of them, parents can teach them that depositing money is also important for themselves when they think of the future. So, we believe that parents can teach the usage of the money to some extent, which is completely different from the university students' period.

So, why is this important? When they are high school students, they use money without thinking. They use money just for themselves and not think about the money, how their parents work, and do not realize the importance of money. However, if they do part-time jobs, they can realize how it is hard for themselves to gain money. We believe that if they realize such important things, they can use their money in a much better way because they will think much more deeply about their money. At this point, we believe that we can set a fundamental sense for using money, and that's why we believe this notion. Thank you.

## Opposition 2nd
I think asking a 50 year old man what they want to eat for lunch is not meaningful interaction. I also think that washing dirty dishes for 10 hours a week wouldn't widen your perspective or help you recognize your dream job in any way. We think that part-time jobs are a meaningless distraction that prevents you from focusing on stuff like studying or like club activities or any other action that is actually needed for your life, and that is why we are so proud to oppose today's notion.

A couple of reputations to the previous speaker before I move on to my main points. Firstly, they talked about how part-time jobs are better because you get more risk, you get a bigger sense of responsibility. He explained that because there's a risk of getting fired, you learn to be responsible and not to be rude and stuff like that, but we think that this kind of sense of responsibility or respect towards people who are above you can also be gained through clubs. We think that even if you do not get fired for being rude at club, you still have social status that you have to protect as club member, and in order to maintain the social status, you will be careful to be polite to seniors, teachers, and so on. So, you don't necessarily have legal contract with your boss to learn how to be responsible. So we think that the benefits are not mutually exclusive.

Then they also talked about how you can interact with many. The first speaker talked about how you can interact with people from different ages, but as I said in the beginning, we think that the characterization of part-time jobs, that it's mostly manual labor, it doesn't really require this communication skills that you actually need, and all in all we think that like interaction can be further achieved on stuff like club activities with your friends or your seniors or your teachers, etc. etc., but you take him. 

<POI>So can all high students can act in a polite way in the club activity with no existing rules and no manners for themselves

It may be hard for high schoolers to be completely polite. But like first of all, I don't think we have that much of a burden to say that high schoolers have to be 100% within club activities because we also say that not all high schoolers would be 100% polite once they start like doing a part-time job, even if you have that legal contract. I think like that doesn't necessarily mean that all kinds of high schoolers would like suddenly be polite.So all in all what we basically want to see is that this kind of legal contract or your fear of being fired is not enough of a reason to say that like you, that say that part-time jobs are necessary to gain this kind of sense of responsibility. 

Secondly, they also talked about how, and I was talking about how you have to interact with like you get to interact with many people but because there's like a lot of, but because there's a lot of like manual labor involved in part-time jobs, this is not necessarily the case.

Finally, they also talked about the sense of responsibility of using money that can be gained through part-time jobs, but we think that firstly they already contradict their main point when they say that students can learn how to take care of money, but at the same time they also say that parents would control it. We think that like this kind of control from their parents like your own like autonomy as like a. As like a spender wouldn't like be able to coexist so it'll either be the student like freely using their money or like the parents getting like a complete hold of their salary. So like either way, I don't get why they would be able to learn this kind of responsibility in the first place. 

And even then we still don't see the specific reason why they have to gain this kind of sense of responsibility while they're in high school. Especially if they have another four years or like for some people like six years in university. So in the end, we think that this kind of skill is not necessarily something that should be gained within the three years of high school life, but what we really need to gain during our three years of high school life is things like academic skills.

For communicative skills that my first speaker talked about which brings us back to our main points. Firstly, the role of high school education. A side opposition believes it's to learn like the basis of how to live in society in the future and like in the long-term, right? In order to do that, firstly, you need to gain like a lot of knowledge to either get into university or maybe it's to get into a specific job or whatever reason. Then you also need to gain things like communication skills, teamwork, or leadership skills, or other soft skills that you need to survive in society. You gain that through daily classes at school and after-school activities, clubs, and we think that these kinds of activities are something that you could only gain in the three years of high school education. Specifically, this kind of opportunity should be the highest priority for students.

Secondly, I'll explain to you why this kind of opportunity would not be able to be achieved once students start gaining a part-time job. So ... the government second speaker said that the wage is not that cheap for part-time jobs, like it's enough for them to sustain themselves and have fun. We think that this is the specific reason why a lot of high school students will keep doing their part-time jobs even at the expense of their academic career getting damaged. Because you're able to gain that money to buy things like bubble tea or go to karaoke or whatever.

This kind of immediate pleasure and immediate financial gain that you can get from part-time jobs is what keeps the students going, and we think that this is very harmful because they don't realize that the long-term benefits that could be gained from studying or going to clubs would not be achieved. But then they prioritize this short-term gain that they can have from part-time jobs, and therefore they keep working. As a result, this is going to be a huge distraction that severely harms their future in the long term. Imagine you have to spend, they said that it could be like 10 hours or so, but we think 10 hours is pretty long for you to spend washing dishes or asking customers what they want for dinner.

We think that this is like a huge distraction for their lives, especially if they have this financial incentive that keeps them going at all costs. The specific difference between clubs and part-time jobs is that clubs in school are made to coexist with the school work. That is to say, like, you can only practice until a certain time. For instance, if you go to a club, there's probably a limit to the time that you can stay at school. Then, you also have a schedule of the club that is suited to your academic work. Maybe you don't have clubs during the test periods, for example.

So, we think that clubs are made to coexist within the school system, and therefore, it's really easy to balance your studying and all the other stuff. The unique thing about part-time jobs is that it's just not made to coexist in the first place. Therefore, what ultimately happens is you either get exploited or pressured by your boss to keep working at all costs and keep working for that money. This leads to getting distracted from a lot of the academic activities that you need to gain during your high school years. This would be a huge harm to your long-term prospects. For all these reasons, we're so proud to oppose.

## Government 3rd
First of all, let me set ground for this, for my speech. So there's two analysis. First is what is high schoolers. So let me analyze high schoolers. There's two analysis. First, those go to college. And the second, those not go to college, as the first speaker said. So the important thing of this analysis is majority of students will work after high school. So let me move on to second one.

So skills they claim, the opposition side claim to be needed. So they argue two points. First, we need communication skills. And secondly, we need academic skills for high schoolers. So they focused on the harm, the harm part-time job have. For example, they, so their first point was harm to academic skills. However, we're very skeptical about the need for academic skills. So as we argued, the majority of students work after, will work after high school, meaning not going to university. So academic skill is not needed for like work, right? So just get into the university. So even though there's a little harm, which club activities will not have that part-time job has to academic skills, it doesn't matter because a lot of, a majority of high schoolers will work after high school. So as we argued, as we argued in the first speaker, primary working, part-time job, primary working experience is good for those students who works after college. 

And secondly, they argued club activity is enough for what we need. So let me compare club activities and part-time jobs. So there's two axes. First, age. So in club activities, there's just like a two-year difference between senpai and kohai. And also, they go to the, because they go to the same school, they have, they have common background. Meanwhile, part-time, in part-time job, the co-worker, the age and backgrounds of co-workers will vary. So communication skills or like some special experience towards a wider variety of people will be there in the part-time job.

And the second axis is responsibility. So they, the opposition side argued club is not the place. So we can, we can have a sense of responsibility throughout the club activities. However, it is not enough because the club is not the place for responsibility. It's, so it's, it's the place for just fun. So even though there's, there's a few club activities which require responsibility, for example, like very strict physical clubs, there is, it really depends on the club's atmosphere. For example, so as we, I said, the club is just for fun. So generally, generally, there's no need to be responsible. 

However, in part-time jobs, there's legal contracts, as I said, no thanks. There's legal contracts, as I said. So there's, and also there's an exchange of money. There's an exchange of money in exchange for their labor. So, and also as the second speaker said, there's, there's always the risk of getting fired. So incentive, incentive for, to be responsible, it's far more stronger in part-time job.

So let me conclude my speech. So because the opposition side misunderstood what they needed, meaning they, so they misunderstandingly believe that academic, academic skill is needed. The harm they argued is meaningless. The harm they argued is meaningless. And also because, and also because club activities will not be the counterpart of the part-time jobs, we are happy to propose. Thank you.

## Opposition 3rd
The problem that opposition bench faces with proposition bench is that they haven't been able to explain first what high school students want. And then we think that there wasn't any kind of clear description and explanation of the mutually exclusiveness of part-time jobs. I'm very happy to propose.

Two things I'll be talking about. First, I'll be explaining what high school students really want. And secondly, I'll be explaining what part-time jobs bring and why, in the majority of instances, there are going to be more harms than benefits of experiencing part-time jobs as uniquely as a high school student.

So first, what do high school students want? I'll be using the classification that the prime minister brings, which is first, people who want to go to universities and people who don't want to go to universities. I'll be explaining why, in both of these situations, there's going to be much bigger harms.

So first, let's look at students who want to go to university. Given that around 90 to 95% of high school students usually want to go to universities, and this is a debate about whether part-time jobs have benefits or harms as a majority. We think this point should be more important than the whip speeches wholly talking about students who don't want to go to universities. We think it's much better on our side if you don't experience part-time jobs for two reasons.

First is because you gain more time to prepare and be provided and you have more opportunities provided to see what you want to do in the future than spending and wasting your time on part-time jobs, right? You're able to study, you're able to gain important skills and knowledge, which is essential to choosing universities and careers because you need to actually have information to do so. For instance, we think it's much better if you study biology to be a biologist, or if you study law to be a lawyer, or play sports to be a professional player. And we think these points are much more important, much more feasible and robust than just, than just, I don't know, for instance, smiling at Burger King or McDonald's, right? We think it's much better.　This is especially important when you consider that you are a high school student and you only have a limited time of three years. We think it's most important to know how to use time management. We think it's much better on our side where you actually have more time to absolutely dedicate all your time on things that are actually important.

On their side, they say that, hey, we could also do club activities and you could just do both club activities and part-time jobs. Notice how this point specifically neglects the variable of high school students because a high school student usually has homework they have to prepare for universities. They also want to have fun with friends, right? The physical burden on mental stress is accelerated when you have to have both clubs and part-time jobs, right? Just one day is enough to save my energy and me having to go to a five-hour shift after that washing dishes for no reason is, I think, rather like meaningless and something that is rather unfeasible. On our side, we do not have these distractions. We also have time to work to polish our resumes for extracurriculars to provide to universities, for instance, which we think part-time jobs rather distracts you. So we say on our side, our side has much more benefits.

But secondly, we say it's much better for poor people because it's going to be a much better investment of trying to go to universities and actually find a good job and a good career and gaining much better income instead of sacrificing your time during your limited three years of high school trying to do something you don't know if you want to do that in the future. Instead, we think that it's irrational for the government side to come up here and just say that these high school students are always going to know what to do from just doing part-time jobs.

But let's look at the second case, right, of students who don't want to go to a university. The problem is this, is that they haven't been able to characterize these people, right? People usually who don't want to go to universities and immediately work are people who want to work at their parents' shop or being a fisherman or people with fixed jobs, right? These people already have jobs they want to do, so this negates proposition's own premise that these people would know what to do from doing part-time jobs because they already have jobs they want to do, right? At this point, we think this is meaningless and this is a waste of time because now they have to do things that won't help you at all.

The government says that academics aren't so important, but we say it is, right? Because if you want to work after your parents' shop, you should rather spend your time being able to focus on what the shop wants looking after all its geographical locations and how it's doing in the economy in the market, for instance, much than just working at a part-time jobs which you're never going to be affiliated without in the future. Therefore, we say it's better for these people to spend time on focusing on the job you're getting rather on their side. That's why for the first point, for what high school students want, our side is able to match the benefits more.

But secondly, let's characterize what part-time jobs and what part-time jobs brings. The whole bench of our proposition was that the part-time jobs extend high school students' vision of the future. This is problematic for two reasons. First, because it simply cannot because part-time jobs offered to high school students is usually the things like washing dishes at Caesarea, pushing buttons at 7-Eleven, or creating fake smiles at Burger King. Why is this so? Because we say there's a structural system in society which makes high school students have to do manual labor. 

This is for two reasons. First is because as high school students, we don't have the certificate or achievements as other people who are higher of age. There's a lack of credibility for high school students which makes them have to do manual labor instead of in kind of high-tech programming, for instance. That's why it's worse on their side and it's much better on our side because we get to prioritize these friends. We get to prioritize our limited time at high school. We say we're much better in not having to waste time in all these meaningless manual labor, which you probably never have to use in the future.

But secondly, even if you neglect all our points coming up for now, we say that their side wasn't able to provide any kind of mutually exclusivity for this point. The only thing that came up here was that, hey, we could just do clubs too. I already explained why that doesn't work. The only unique thing that came up here was that apparently, you know how to use your money management. 

The problem is, right after the second speaker came up here and said that if parents are able to control the money of high school students, that doesn't teach money management, right? It simply doesn't make sense. And it's also not related to the point where part-time jobs offer you money but don't teach you how to manage your money properly. If you want to know how to manage money, you should just do that with the allowance your parents provide you.

At this point, we think that failing in explaining the difference between part-time jobs while we explain it uniquely just in clubs or prioritizing your friends is much better. Because we prioritize the needs of students and talk to you about how part-time jobs bring more harms, I'm happy to oppose.

## Opposition 4th
The biggest issue with Proposition's case is that they do not have a clear benefit of what you could specifically gain from the three years of part-time job experience that you gained during high school.

On the other hand, what we as opposition have consistently been telling you from the beginning is that these kinds of academic and communicative skills that you could gain from your school classes or your club activities are something unique to high school and something that we need to protect. That is why we're so proud to oppose today's motion.

So let's go over today's debate. The two main clashes are which side has long term benefits that are actually useful for the child's future. All in all, we think that as a premise, we see the high schoolers because they don't have any academic record or a cool master's degree or something. We simply don't have the capability nor credibility to get into a really high skill job. So as a result, the majority of the part-time jobs that they will be experiencing is manual labor. This is like washing dishes or doing like asking what they want to eat for dinner or stuff like that. And we think that as a result, opposition fails to clarify the specific benefits that you can gain from these kinds of part-time jobs.

So let's take their best case and assume that this kind of legal contract makes you like a more responsible person. Even if that is the case, we still see that the kind of responsibility that you do gain out of it is quite marginal. We think that all you have to do to be responsible in a part-time job is simply to be at that shop at the designated time and do some chores. Right. And then you're like counted as responsible. We think that this kind of responsibility is not really valuable compared to the responsibility that you gain as a member of a sport team or like fulfilling your role as like a reply speaker or like whatever thing you do in clubs. We think that the kind of skills and the kind of responsibility that you ultimately get out of part-time jobs is quite small compared to the benefits that can be achieved on our side.

And secondly, the other benefit that they talked about was about this kind of interaction that you can gain between people. Firstly, we say that their model already contradicts with their stance because it seems that high schoolers only get to work for like 10 hours a week. But still, we also see that like the kind of like manual labor prevents them from like any kind of like constructive communication with like peers or like people older than you in the first place. So compared to that, again, the communication that you can gain within the school is more sufficient and more beneficial for these students.

But finally, they also talk about the financial responsibility that they can gain through the motion. But we think that this ends up in like two spectrums. It's either you waste off all your salary on bubble tea or like your parents take all the cash. Right. So in the end, we don't think the high schoolers are capable and nor is it feasible for them to gain this kind of financial responsibility once they start doing a part-time job.

So let's look at the comparative. Right. What can we actually gain by preventing them from doing part-time jobs? We think that by focusing on your school life, whether it's like academic or whether it's something to do with clubs, we think that this has like a long term benefit on the students because first of all, they gain these kinds of soft skills, right? Like communication skills or like teamwork or like learning to respect your seniors or like fulfilling your role in like a team or like leadership and like other other skills.

And let's look at like academic skills. Right. So again, let's take their best case and say that like most students don't go to university anyway. So academic skills are important. We think that like firstly, we think that academic skills are not necessarily like getting into that university or having like an elite record. We think that like even if you don't go to university in the end, like working hard to get that good grade on the test or like studying and like sharing your thoughts together with your peers is in itself like a valuable experience. Even if you don't go to university in the future. 

And compared to that, the kind of like tedious and repetitive manual labor that you're going to experience through a part-time job is like a meaningless act. And that doesn't lead to any useful skills compared to what you could gain from working hard studying.

So all in all, regardless of what kind of future that you are going into for the long term benefit and the happiness of the students as a whole, we think that they should never experience part-time jobs during their high school career. And that is why we're so proud to oppose. Thank you.

## Government 4th
Part-time jobs are an easier way for students to learn social skills. At a point that the manners are written and they have to behave responsibly, and they can learn how to use the money. At this point, we strongly believe today's motion. So, today we have two main points here. The first point is about the academic skills, and the second point is about the social skills.

So, first, let me talk about the academic skills. We believe that the students can also maintain a balance between the part-time jobs and studying. So, high school students have enough chance to think of the future. No one will do a part-time job all day when the entrance exam will be held two months later. So, they will be able to maintain the balance between studying and part-time job. 

And this is also done when it comes to club activities. Students are able to maintain, even now, the balance between studying and club activities, which is club activities are the same as part-time jobs. At a point that they spend about 10 hours a week, which is completely different from studying. We believe that they can maintain the balance between the part-time jobs and studying. And if they cannot do that, it can also be said that they cannot maintain the balance between club activities and studying. So, we believe that there will be no difference between the people who are doing club activities and people who are doing the part-time jobs and club activities.

Next, let me talk about the social skills, which is the most important thing in the participation. So, they said that they can learn a lot of social skills in the club activities. They said that they can learn how to behave against seniors. However, they can learn a lot of social skills, for example, how to behave against senior people. However, we believe that club activities are completely different from part-time jobs. To the point that they can quit easily the club activities when they have some difficulty in the club activities. 

And also, the rules are not written. So, it is difficult for students to know the rules. Feeling the atmosphere and changing behavior is so difficult for high school students. On the other hand, in part-time jobs, first of all, the manners are written. So, it is easier for students to learn social skills because they can learn the manners while they are doing part-time jobs because the manners are written.

The second point is that they have to behave responsibly, and they can somehow find a way to get along with who they hate. And the salary can be a huge motivation for these kinds of things which cannot be done when they are in the club activities. Because if there are some people they hate, they can quit easily. But salary can be a huge motivation in the part-time jobs.

The third thing is about how to use money. So, what will happen if they do not do part-time jobs in high school and they just get a lot of huge money when they are in the universities? So, when they are in the universities, they can do a lot of part-time jobs and they will get a lot of money. However, there is no one who can tell the importance and tell how to use the money. So, at the point when they are high school students, parents can control to some extent. 

And this is important because the parents can realize, can make them know how it is important to use and how they can truly use the money for themselves. And in this point, we believe that the social skills gained by the part-time jobs are bigger than only done in the club activities. So, that's why we strongly believe this motion. Thank you.
