Rating: Rather disagree

Reasoning:

1. **Direct References**: The Government 2nd speaker attempted to refer directly to opposition arguments by distinguishing between murder and dueling, trying to address the issue of informed consent brought up by the opposition. They mentioned that participants in duels have strong wills and consent, attempting to refute the notion that dueling is like forced murder. However, this response lacks specific engagement with the detailed scenarios provided by the opposition regarding gang and partner pressures.

2. **Specific Engagement**: The Opposition 1st speaker engaged with the Prime Minister's example of revenge by the victim's families and countered with the role of the justice system and drew parallels to the death penalty. This was a specific attempt to refute the government's justification of duels as a form of justice.

3. **Direct Refutation**: The Opposition 2nd speaker addressed the government's claim that dueling to death can satisfy individuals with a desire for revenge or justice, arguing instead that such desires are unrealistic and that psychopaths wouldn't be satisfied by dueling. This interaction attempts to directly challenge the logic behind government claims, though it doesn't fully engage with the personal autonomy argument proposed by the government.

4. **Building/Extending**: The Opposition 3rd speaker expanded on why forcing individuals into duels due to external pressures (like gang influence) makes the choice irrational, directly tackling the government’s rebuttal about mutual consent. This engagement was more robust but didn't fully respond to the government's model and claims of government oversight preventing this issue.

5. **Limited Interaction**: The Government 4th speaker's arguments about duels being personal matters not significantly affecting the country did not engage with opposition concerns about societal impacts, such as normalization of violence and the potential slippery slope mentioned by opposition speakers.

Overall, while each side attempted to engage with the other's arguments, significant points raised by each team were not thoroughly addressed or directly countered. There were parallel arguments regarding the morality of dueling and the tools of state justice that were not specifically engaged with by either team comprehensively.

# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #12 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

# Debate Transcripts
## Government 1st
Ladies and gentlemen, imagine when there's a certain criminal that killed your family. Killed all your family and in a bloody situation and you can't do anything in those kinds of circumstances. We believe in those kinds of situations, those individuals are suffering from those kinds of coercive situations and they can't relieve their stress, relieve their desire in the student school. What we have to do is as a government, we have to respect like those kinds of people's choices and those kinds of people's desire to have to win to them. These are reasons why we are proud to propose. 

For today's debate, I have two arguments, one why we can justify for taking this motion to how society can move to respect innocent people's choices.

Before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear definition and model for today's debate. So like let me have a three-model for today's debate. One, we are fully respecting choices and having a constant between the people who are doing dueling to death, which is having a prescription that is before having dueling to death and several steps are given by doing as a rule. And we are preventing a forceful situation like such as using dueling to death as a bad thing. So what we are going to do is second, having government control, which government can like access those dueling to death quickly. And as I said in the first, like constant and having several prescription, government is having like those kinds of prescriptions and receiving like those kinds of prescriptions. So as like forceful situation will be given, government will like stop like dueling to death. Thirdly, but most importantly, we're making dueling to death as a fight, as an ability, not like using like those kinds of weapons. And that's all.

So move on to my argument. One, why we can justify this motion by taking into the society. So like firstly, let me like clarify what is happening in the status quo. In the status quo, no regulation to fight and respect choices and like no regulation for respecting people are given, right? So the reason is because this society is now like neglecting from having a duel and neglecting from killing each other, right? But those kinds of virtue given in today's society is now having a horrible situation for individuals. 

<POI> What are the situations when people are willing to duel to death, when they know that like in the 50% possibility, they are going to die? Tell me the context of that, of this debate. 

Okay, the context is really simple. Like when like those individuals have a certain like desire that wants to kill like such a person, we're going to respect like those kinds of people. And so if they want to kill someone, like maybe like the opponent side won't be like accepted. But when there's a such like situation, when the opponent side like accepts like those kinds of desire, like we will like have dueling to death. 

But I will like explain that more in my constructive speech, right? So as I showed in the status quo, like those kinds of like government is not like having a certain respectful situation for this society, right? But the problem is in the status quo, there's some individual that have a desire that wants to kill people as a reason to hate people, to wanted to kill people, and wanted to like accomplish their like certain suffer in the status quo, right? For example, like when, as I said in the introduction, when family is killed, like in those kinds of situations, individuals are like now having a certain suffer that they want to kill like the criminals, right? So as an extension of like those kinds of choices, we have to respect like those individuals that want to kill like those criminals, or want to kill like those opponent side. 

So what is the reason that these kinds of like criminals or like these kinds of persons who have the high possibility to be killed are going to do these kinds of like dueling to the death? Why is it so? So like we're not saying that like 100% this like dueling to death will be given, but we believe that this motion will like at some like part or at some like point, we can respect and we can like accomplish like those kinds of situations. So for like the conclusion of my like first argument, why we can justify is that we have to respect innocent people that suffer from stress, suffering from like desire that are taken, right? So when like both like choices were now accomplished, and when like those both choices at some like point they like accomplished, we will like take this motion and this is justifiable in today's society. 

So second, like how it will like change this society and respect innocent choices. I have like no time, so I will give it to like my second speaker, but we like strongly believe that this motion will like make like those individuals that couldn't like accomplish this desire in the status quo can like accomplish and we can save those people that can't like pursue like in the status quo. So these are reasons why we're part of it.

## Opposition 1st
In dueling, there is always the winner and the loser. It is definitely murder. So even if the loser has already given consent to the risk, that kind of murder is not something that is justified. And we say that choice is not even possible in practical perspective.

So firstly, I'll get some responses to the Prime Minister. And then the three things. Firstly, what kind of people opt in dwelling? Secondly, why dwelling is not justified? And thirdly, why legal institutions are better?

So firstly, the idea that the Prime Minister gave you is such a nonsense. So they are practically standing for murder. They said when someone wants to kill someone, we should respect their choices, but we don't see any difference from murder. 

And moreover, their main example was the revenge by the families of the victim. We have two responses. So firstly, this is completely out of this debate because as for the criminals, we already have justice system that seeks to the fair punishment for those criminals. And those revenge.

And so secondly, even if the victim needs to kill the criminal, we don't see any difference from death penalty because if the government wants the criminal to be killed, they can introduce death penalty. And that is better for them because the family of victim won't have to risk their lives to commit their revenge. So their argument falls out of this debate.

And now we want to my constructs. So firstly, why dueling to death is unjustifiable? We say because the choice to opt in dueling is such an irrational and forced choice. So in order to protect people from dying because of the irrational choice, we should not take this motion. 

So three reasons why their choices are irrational. So first of all, but before that, we say the kind of people who want to opt in dueling is the people who have troubles that they don't want to solve in courts. But especially, we think mafias are likely to use dueling as their means to solve problems because mafia is a kind of people who can risk their life in their jobs. So and another example is like people who are fighting for their partners. For example, the two men can fight for a woman and those kind of things are so arbitrary and they don't want to settle in courts.

So having said that, why those choices are irrational? So firstly, as for mafias, the duelers are pursued by their bosses. Why? Because it is likely that the bosses in the gangs don't want to risk their own lives. So they are likely to force their fellow members to get into dueling. And the fellow member has to do dueling because if they reject their job, they will get killed by their boss. So they'll take risk and they engage in dueling.

So second of all, the circumstances can force people into dueling. In example that the two men are fighting for one woman, the fight heats up and the woman can say things like, show me your power and now get married with one of you that will win the duel. In this case, the both men will have such pressure and will have practically no choice to not get into dueling and still will make irrational choices.

And thirdly, there is no informed consent. Think about who will talk about the experience of dueling because the loser will no longer exist in this world anymore. People who are considering dueling will only hear stories from survivors. The survivors might talk about how their problems perfectly solved after experiencing dueling, but they won't talk about, they don't talk about how the victim were suffering or something. So this will lead to possible dealers unseeing their risk.

And fourthly, people cannot experience being harmed, being injured or being killed because that's because of obvious reason.

And lastly, why irrational choice is so bad? Because the harms cannot be reversed. That in the dueling, people will die and they are no way to return from this. And also they will have a traumatic experience of seeing someone die or huge injury that will make them impossible to walk for their whole life. And there is no going back before the moment of dueling. So we have to protect those citizens. 

And even if the choice is irrational, the government has a moral obligation to protect its people. For example, there is a seat belt law. When people don't put on seat belt, no one will get in trouble except those person, but the government asks people to put on seat belts to protect themselves. So states have the right to protect its people.

So second, why legal institutions feel better? So the next speaker will explain about this more in detail, but because of obvious reasons, courts have less harm because in courts, no one will die, obviously. 

And secondly, this will become a more fundamental solution. Why? Because in dueling, even if we introduce more fair power, people who have more power will live. And this is not something that is justified and the government has to protect especially weak people. Therefore, in order to protect its people, we should not take this motion. Thank you.

## Government 2nd
So let me explain what the differences are between murder and the people who do duels. There are three differences. First of all, the people who do jewels know probably they might be killed, right? Because a murderer kills somebody thinking they won't be killed the next day or something like that. So this is the first difference. The next difference is that both have a clear aim to fight. This is because the first speaker has said that there is mutual consent before they go to do duels. So and then the third difference is they do it for themselves and have a strong will for each other. They have a strong will, and I'll talk about it later too, but they have strong wills to fight others. So they have the will to kill by the fight. And this is the difference. So I would like to move on to the rebuttal.

The opposition side has said mafias do pressure to the member of the gang or something like that. So people who do jewels might be the member of a gangster or etc. So they might have pressure from mafias. But we have two rebuttals. First of all, they will have preceding to do that, as the first speaker has explained at the definition. 

And secondly, the government already knows which is the gang, for example, Yamaguchi-gumi or Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi. And the government has to be strict in the research. So I will explain that later too.

Next, about the fight for like two men fighting for a woman. So the government will do the research. What are the aims to do duels? These examples are maybe not a good aim to fight. So maybe the government will research about that. Maybe like you cannot do the duel. 

And next, we would like to rebut to informed consent. So why this is not true, because they have that risk that the winner says him or herself about he's a bad guy or something like that to fight with. So they have well that like others can say anything about that if he or she loses. 

So I would like to move on to the reconstruction. And they also talk about our second argument and about changing society. So we think that changing, they said if we don't take this motion, we can have less harm. But nowadays, there are many murders. There are many murders to kill someone. But we think that we can reduce the crime by murder because they can reflect their minds by doing duels. This can be a point that can reduce the number of people who don't want to be killed by someone. So this is a benefit for our side.

So our first argument about our argument was the initial hate. We can respect individual hate and do the drills. So they have rights. And if we don't take this motion, is it difficult to fulfill? Not like difficult to fulfill, right? So if we take this motion, we can reflect their minds that by not being arrested or not illegal, and this is the only choice to reflect their feeling and suffer.

So next, I would like to talk about it is okay to urge ways to do duels that the government urges ways to do duels. So this is necessary to save the choice that respects the individual. So these drills give people the reflection, right? This means that the government can pursue their freedom. So the government has the responsibility to make options for people to make them happy or make freedom.

So maybe they might say mutual contents are not good because not good or like they cannot find the people who have pressure from others. But recently, we had lots of information to research everything, even if it's the information of gangs or other secret organizations. By this research, we can prevent fights that people do drills by tops pressure, tops, or mafia's pressure. So for these reasons, we would like to strongly propose the motion. Thank you.

## Opposition 2nd
I think they've already lost this debate at the point when Deputy Prime Minister told us that killing based on the aim of gangs or killing based on relationship is something unjust. 

On the other hand, when the Prime Minister told us that the desire to kill other people is justified and the government needs to respect that, we don't really understand where the criteria are being drawn to begin with. 

But second of all, we told you that that criteria in itself is obviously going to be arbitrary. They either have to ban everything or they need to allow individuals to duel to death in any circumstances at the point when the Prime Minister told us that the primary principle why we have to allow it is the desire to kill other people and the rational mindset that they have. When the fight between relationships is due to the rational mindset, as they say, we think that they have to agree in the contextualization that we have provided from the side opposition.

Several independent responses to a side opposition. First of all, they told us they have this desire to kill other people and the government needs to respect that. I'm going to have a substantial why killing other people in itself is morally wrong. But before several independent responses, number one, we tell you that it's completely an unrealistic characterization where many people have this desire to kill other people. You don't often see those people to begin with because your morality in itself is going to pressurize your desire to kill other people. And obviously, I think in the vast majority of cases, people will even think about killing other people as their desires. 

But second of all, even if you agree to a certain extent that those psychopaths exist under the status quo, those people wouldn't be fulfilled by dueling to death. Because most of the time, those psychopaths' aim is not to kill other people by fighting. Their goal is to batter others, is to abuse others and to torture others with you standing upon the person who you are torturing upon, right? Those cases happen when people sexually assault other people and after that, murder that person. Or those instances come when people use your gun and mass shoot everywhere. That's the desire that those individuals want to have, the desire that you are actually oppressing those individuals and that person cannot even revenge to you. These kinds of emotions are urging them to kill other people and we don't think fighting with other people by fist to fist is going to help their desires to begin with. 

But secondly, they told us that the criminal justice system people, like the victims, want to kill other people, want to kill the perpetrators that killed your family. Several independent responses to that. Number one, we tell you that those murderers are going to be put on justice in the criminal justice system and we don't necessarily think that this is inside the debate to begin with. We think that it's irrelevant. 

But secondly, we tell you, even if that is true to a certain extent, we tell you that obviously that perpetrator is not going to agree to the fight where he has the possibility to be killed. I don't know what they are talking about to begin with. We don't think that the benefit that they are talking about is actually going to be tangible.

So two things that I'm going to be talking about in my debate. Number one, I'm going to be talking about why the counterfactual on their side is going to be worse off and why the counterfactual is going to be better off on our side of the house. Number two, I'm going to be talking about why killing other people in itself is something morally wrong.

First of all, talking about why the counterfactual is going to look like. I think that the leader of opposition did a really great job by providing a certain kind of context that we need to debate in this debate, right? These kinds of contexts are like arguing between a relationship or arguing between gangs or financial troubles that happen under the status quo. 

So let's look at it one by one. First of all, when it comes to the context of the relationship, I think that it wouldn't be solved in any kind of circumstances to begin with, right? Even if you win by killing or harming other people, the fact that you killed someone and the fact that you harmed the other person is going to force you to have a sense of regret, right? Because in general, in society, it's regarded to kill other people as a morally wrong thing. It is regarded morally wrong to harm other people, right? And I don't think that it's going to change even after taking this motion. The vast majority of citizens are going to think like that, right? And that influences your idea as well. So even if you win that case, even if you get that female, we think that it is not going to make them happy. But rather, like whenever you look at your partner that you have won by dueling to death, you have this sense of regret that you actually have killed that person and that you did something morally wrong that you shouldn't even exist under the society, right? 

But secondly, we tell you that when it comes to like financial trouble, we say that the counterfactual is far more likely better than we can provide on our side of the house, right? The court can objectively decide who actually has the responsibility to pay to someone. And we think that this is completely better because it doesn't involve an arbitrary factor, right? 

So when it comes to dueling to death, your strength or like the fortune that you had is going to matter in the vast majority of cases. 

On the other hand, when it comes to courts, courts can decide objectively based on evidence, based on facts, right? We tell you that it's far more better for courts to decide in those instances as well. Even for the relationship case, we tell you that like talking with the other person is definitely going to be better because you will no longer have this sense of regret even if you can win that person. When you win that person, you can win that person and that is going to be, that's going to satisfy you for a long time.

Briefly, why killing another person is regarded as morally wrong thing? Like I think in general, people would agree that killing other people is morally wrong thing even with a consent, right? Even when you see the instance of gang having a dispute with consent, still you regard that as something morally wrong thing, right? 

And we tell you that the states have to follow the general principle that society has in general, right? That means that when people regard something as a morally wrong thing, when people regard hate speech as a morally wrong thing, obviously you need to ban that. The same thing applies here as well. Even if there's consent, like when people regard like dispute against, dispute between gangs or helping in committing suicide is a morally wrong thing, we tell you that the state needs to follow that. Therefore, we are happy to oppose.

## Government 3rd
First, I'm going to talk about how dueling begins. First, someone has heard it from someone or has a desire to kill someone. For example, if one of the family members is killed by murder, they have a strong desire to kill someone and also have strong hatred for someone. Hatred can't be dealt with in other ways. So, when we face this motion, when we face this situation, we can support this motion. 

What is the difference between murder and duels? Murderers are not aware that their actions will lead to someone's death, but duelists are aware that their actions will lead to this. Duels are more justified than murder because we are aware that we are going to duel from now on, and this requires the agreement of both parties. By taking this motion, regrets are never formed because we are aware that this action leads to this exact consequence. So, this is justified, and we are going to move on to reconstruction.

The first and second speakers said to respect their choice. The government legalized in the constitution clearly states that the country respects the nation's freedom rights, but the government doesn't legalize that people don't die by intentional action. For example, in some countries, assisted suicide is accepted by respecting one's decision to choose this. 

I know that this example and duels are truly different because assisted suicide does not involve killing others. But the common point between duels and assisted suicide is that both involve a person with strong will. Respecting one's choice is one of the most important things that the government must make everyone aware of. Even if someone was forced by a strong person, whether to die or not is a personal decision, and this decision cannot be made by others. Whether to die or not is a personal decision, so if they decide to duel to the death, we must respect their choice, and this is the government's responsibility. So, for these reasons, we should take this motion.

## Opposition 3rd
Freedom of choice is not an absolute value. Even now, you're prohibited to use hard drugs or take euthanasia by the law of government, right? Well, I know that there may be some stresses because you cannot take those choices, the individual choices, but we we're prohibiting for these things for several reasons. 

One is that these things, like the personal lives, are the precious and are the are never going going back or recover after you lose it once. If you lose your life once, you dismiss that your life is not going to be go back again, and if these things are going to dumb by like irrational choices, we think that is very harmful. 

However, the government, even there's some kind of like governmental control, we cannot like, we cannot regulate all the things. For example, if in the euthanasia, for example, in Belgium, a lot of people die by the irrational choices that, oh, I, because like, for example, I was being unemployed or like other reasons, and because of these irrational reasons, people die or lose their life by these irrational reasons. We say that the government should intervene and and should not allow any kind of thing because we cannot judge and we should stop any kind of thing. And the government duty is it predicts the students from the life from the irrational choices.

So we say and and now and we think that now it is better than them because we say that in in the present situation, people don't have these kinds of choices, so they're not going to be rationalized and try to kill a something like a murderer who is strong enough like Muhammad or like death hunting even you're going to die or like that. We think that these things are just going to sacrifice more people of them in the studies and we think that it's unjust, unjust.

Secondly, we're going to say that the radicalization in the study is going to happen, and so we are going to prohibit from what is. So we we say that if the government is going to legalize this means the government is going to publicly say it is okay to do like these are like dueling to the death

And the students will say that, oh, these things, these dueling to the death, is a good thing or in the study. So what's going to happen is the radicalization is going to happen, for example, if you if you have some some kind of like choices these choices are going to have more slippery, so these these things will be extended more people will die.

Secondly, we say that the radicalization is going to happen because people want to see it, for example, in in the in the ancient Rome a lot of people died in the coruscant and kill other peoples in there, because people want to see more exciting things. For example, if you're going to see porn movies, people may say that they think it's not fun and do not want to watch it anymore. Porn movies are made to try to make more funny things. For example, more radical porn movie. This is the same kind of thing we say that if you're going to have these kind of things. We think that the individuals are going to see these things as entertainment and people are going to people are going to see them for fun. We think that it is morally out in the first place. 

But secondly we say that this is going to have more harm for example the exploitation of the poor peoples because they want to get money or like that we think that these things are going to have more radicalization more and more killing more and more death in the studies and we think the government should not allow it.

Third reason is that these kind of like we say that it is legitimate to not allow any kind of thing when the harm overrides the benefit. What is their benefit? They said the benefits that they can do by the duelling to the death is that they can maybe take some kind of like stresses or the desire and they can have some kind of like desires. But firstly this is only a small part of the solvency. We think that this solvency is very low and it's not going to be a fundamental solution. I'd like to talk later. 

But secondly we say that that the inter that our harm is going to have more and then comparing with them because firstly the people's life are going to be lost. Secondly, we say the government cannot have like give more like moral things but they're going to have more harmful moral for the individuals in the side and it for the children we think that is harmful surely we say that that radicalization of the people kills kmore people because we say that people will try to try to do these I do willing to do this and more people will die in society we think that it is unjust.

Fourth reason is that um the pressure and um we think that this kind of like exploitation by the pressure is going to happen for example and as we told you there are like unwilling deaths by the these families or like other members in in like Belgium where euthanasia is going to be realized and even though there are some steps steps or content the individual. And invisible pressure corrupts people's life try to strive people to go to death. It's going to kill these people.

We think that these things are unjustifiable. We say that because these harms are significantly outweighing their the harm and the benefit that they're saying that that they can take those stresses or desire we think that it is unjust.

But secondly, we like and we like to talk and we like to talk about why their benefits are not going to work well or it's very small. Alright, firstly, um, firstly, um, we think that their model is not going to work because as we told you the governmental control is not an absolute thing. There are going to be some kind of like individual invisible pressure by the studies set by the families or by others. We think that these things are going to happen.

But secondly, if you're going to have a strong ability like Muhammad Adi or like this kind of person and if you are strong enough, we say that you're not going to have like, um, because you're going to not going to have like weapons in the opponent. You say that, um, I'm not going to be killed in some kind of like these kind of do willing to the death. We think that these people cannot have any kind of relevancy. But surely, it is unjustifiable to kill criminals. 

Before we're going to talk about these kind of like undefiable or not, we say that firstly the criminals, they don't have any kind of like in content or they don't have any kind of incentive to take these kind of willing to the death. We think that there is no benefit for these criminals, right? We say that these things are not going to move well.

But secondly, we say that, as we told you, the courts should decide these things. For example, we have death penalty. And we think that it is better because you have rehabilitation or like other things. But, and moreover, even after killing or even after you can kill this kind of person, what remains is only an emptiness feeling and more stressive that you cannot put away to others. That is actually why we think that this cannot be the solvency, and our side is better therefore. We are happy to oppose. Thank you.

## Opposition 4th
I'm going to conclude this speech by two criteria. Number one, even proclaiming the government case is perfect, why the choice execution in and of itself is invalid? Second of all, in terms of solving the issue, why opposition paradigm can solve much fairly and harmlessly solve the issue?

Moving on to the first point. Okay, so we have already told you there is no rational consent and choice execution is available under dueling. And we have told you two reasons. A, because this is oftentimes forced choice. Like we say, the gang member, for example, trouble in partnership is going to be a massive reason for someone to start participating in dueling. And obviously, there is no rational consideration behind that. If gang members, lower-class persons, are forced or told to participate in dueling for financial reasons or land traveling reasons, there is no optional choice to reject that, right? 

Partnership reasons are, of course, the same, that if a girl says, I am going to choose someone who won the game, who wins the game. Obviously, two men have no choice to reject, to actively appeal, you are weaker than the other, right? That's why there is no rationally free choice, which is free from forced choice. There is no such a beautiful environment is guaranteed.

On this point, the government says, in case only this is a good aim, we are going to legalize it. But there is no clarification of the definition. What's the difference between good reason and bad reason? So we reject that definition in the very first places. That's why in the very first step, there is a massively forced choice. So this is invalid.

And the second one is that they don't know the consequences. That's why they cannot make a rational decision. Government say, because they know the consequences and they concede it to the death, it's okay to legalize it. But we reject that premise in the very first place. Ordinary people don't really know how actually they are going to be hospitalized. What does it mean to break the bones? What does it mean to dysfunctionalize their organ in the dueling in the very first place? 

That's why we only allow someone to fight when they are enough trained. For example, if they are professional boxer or MMA fighter who are really trained well, who already know the pain well, and when they get a professional license, at that moment, they are legalized to fight in the Kurosu-Yodogama Stadium, ladies and gentlemen. That's why in comparison to these kind of ordinary people who don't really know anything, we shouldn't legalize it. 

That's why in the very first place, in terms of this kind of the exclusion of the harmful activity, we shouldn't allow the bodily autonomy like my great partner already explained, seatbelt, right? Even someone who is happy to get an accident and get killed by getting an accident in the car, this is not allowed. This kind of the will should be limited by governmental limitation. 

Euthanasia context is very different because first of all, euthanasia itself doesn't cause harm to other people. Second of all, in the very first place, euthanasia is not a very applicable example internationally. It is only partly legalized. That's why this is not a universally good example. That's why this is not a valid choice.

Moving on to the solving a problem issue. So I have a few issues here. First of all, this debate is not about whether or not the private punishment by a victim is allowed. This is not the debate, right? So of course, that benefit, all the benefit is not gonna happen when the criminal actually rejects the offer of the dueling in the very first place. That's why the victim does not necessarily have to be satisfied.

And the second of all, even if they somehow win, even if they somehow win, still it's not good because there is no root cause identification why the criminals happen and what kind of the rationale behind the criminal. And there is no actual compensation in terms of finance or in terms of the imprisonment of the criminal, ladies and gentlemen. So for all these two reasons, we will be happy to vote.

## Government 4th
First, I would like to say that our goal is to prevent people from suffering after an event. And I would also like to clarify that we are not trying to encourage duels, just like drinking alcohol is legal when research shows that it is more dangerous than marijuana.

One of the questions raised in the debate was, how are duels to the death justifiable? The opposition side said that killing is generally seen as morally wrong, like hate speech. However, hate speech hurts a huge group of people without their consent, and the damage that they get lasts for such a long time. However, duels that apply to this emotion are personal, and the only person whose pride will be hurt is the opponent, who is 100% sure that they have enough ability to have a fair fight, and they know that there won't be abuse or torture. If the opponent knew that they would be abused and tortured, they definitely wouldn't give consent.

There was an argument that there would be people who would very likely be forced to fight. But as we said in our definition, we will conduct investigations so that we can ensure fair fights and that the people who are fighting know that they have enough abilities.

The opposition side has been acting like the whole country will be harmed, but this motion will only affect the opponent, and it is a personal matter.

In their second point, they said that because losers won't live, they won't be able to say how hurt they were or leave messages. But not all losers will die, and their point about how messages of their harm won't last does not stand. Thank you.
