Rating: Rather disagree

Reasoning:

1. **Direct Engagement**: There was some degree of direct engagement in the debate. The Opposition 1st speaker attempted to respond to the Government's argument about parents forcing children by claiming that parents have more knowledge and can make better decisions. This was a direct response to the Government's stance on freedom and self-determination for children. 

2. **POI Interactions**: Both teams utilized Points of Information (POIs) that directly addressed points made by the opposing team. For example, the Government's POI challenged the Opposition's argument on tiger parents facilitating artistic careers, which shows an attempt to directly rebut an opposing argument.

3. **Specific Rebuttals**: The Government 2nd speaker explicitly mentioned flaws in the Opposition's argument about the knowledge of tiger parents, thereby showing engagement with the overall claim posited by the Opposition.

4. **Limited Engagement**: Despite the instances of engagement, a significant portion of the debate saw both sides running their own principled cases rather than consistently addressing each point made by the other side. For instance, the Opposition 2nd speaker continued to argue about the benefits of tiger parenting without sufficiently addressing specific harms outlined by the Government.

5. **Missed Opportunities for Interaction**: Throughout the debate, there were key points that were cited but not thoroughly engaged with. The Opposition seemed to miss refuting specific points about the psychological impacts discussed by the Government team, focusing instead on why tiger parenting might be necessary, which was not directly responsive to the specific harms outlined.

Overall, while there were attempts to engage with opposing arguments, both sides could have been more consistent and thorough in their interactions, as a lot of the debate consisted of parallel arguments.

# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #9 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

## Government 1st
However, we see things like extreme procrastination and becoming a drug addict, for instance, is something we wouldn't accept as normal parents wouldn't either.

And next, I'm going to talk about what is time parenting. The first is ignorance, fear, guilt of the child. Parents often times try to relive their life, their child, because parents failed their life, their effort of life. For example, if they fail in the university exams, they want to do their, they force their children to pass the exam, and they want them to live a part of parents' life instead of them. But this deprives child the chance to find the passion and self-actualize.

And the second is deprives opportunities of child. The parents often cry from school, and the parents often go, often forced to go to their children from school and piano class, and like that. So if they, if the parents force their children to do that, they don't have, they don't, children don't have enough time to play and don't have a hobby and don't go out with friends. That is necessary for child's health and a dreading identity. Playing with their children causes children's heart more, heart more kind, and to play with their friends, to learn many, many about important things, more than a study and other, other skill, like point. No, thank you. So to lose their, to lose these times is, is harm their child.

And the third is preaches academic success of child, and parents often think, parents often think academics and other skills, like piano and sports, is most important, is most important than, than anything else. If they, if they force their children, that is, that is wrong, and that is not for you. Parents, parents, parents may have violence to their children, and parents mind, and parents mind be, be harmed, harmed by their, children's mind harmed by their parents. Point.

And, and the, and, and more parents often their children become first place, and they teach their child, other friend, your friends is in a mind, in a mind for you, and, and they teach their children, don't, don't, don't, don't. Point. Don't, do not become friends, then, and, friend, and, then parents force their children do only study or do only piano. So, children can't their, can't anything what they want to do, so, if we, if we take this motion we can't protect their children's rights for these reasons. But, we won't by reparenting. Thank you for listening.

## Opposition 1st
So, I would like to oppose to the governments I have said. First of all, I would like to oppose about the parents who force the children is not good.And next, I would like to oppose about the children opportunity to play with other friends. 

First of all, about parents force the children is not good. So, this is not true because children have less ability to choose something. So, parents have more ability to choose something. So, they have more, they already study many things and know about society. So, parents have more, can choose more right way.

And next, I would like to oppose about the children opportunity to play with friends. So, if the children go to swimming school or something like that, art school or something like that. If they go there, they can make friends, right? And children can talk with friends while they are changing clothes or drawing pictures or something like that.

So, I would like to move on to our arguments. So, I would like to explain three things. First of all, I would like to explain about the choice for the future. And next, I would like to explain what will happen if we ban this motion. And next, then I will explain about the necessity to ban tiger parenting.

So, first of all, about the choice for the future. We think this is very good for children. Because music schools or cram schools or art schools can draw children's capability or potential. For example, your children and your parents let you to go to many schools and swimming school or art dance or something like that. And you have talent to do something. If the parents let you to go to the schools, children can know what they are good at. And they can draw their potential. And if they get older, they can become some dancer or artist or something like that. So, this is good for children. Point. No, thank you.

And I would like to explain what will happen if we ban. So, if we ban this motion, maybe their children can have freedom. But this affects bad effect. Because if we take this motion, parents will support the children. If we take this motion, if the children say no to something, parents can say to that. Because parents will be afraid of that. The action might be abusing. And if the parents will be afraid of that action, the children might be abusing. They can school children or can let something to do. And also, we can define that. What is a tiger parent? Clearly, right? This circumstance will produce that parents support children.

And I would like to explain about the necessity to ban tiger parents. So, parents can… Point. Yes. Taken. 

<POI>Do you think tiger parents will let their kids be dancers or singers? Or would they just force them to study for the rest of their lives? 

And the next speaker will say about that. If we don't take this motion, parents can choose how to raise their children. So, some parents will do tiger parents. And other will allow to do anything about it. So, even if we don't take this motion, parents have to raise their children. They also have rights to how to raise their children. If the parents want children to grow up like some ideal something, they can raise like that. And also, if the parents want children to spoil, it's fine. The choice for the future for the children. And it will bring good to children.

Finally,... I forgot to say about what will happen if we ban. Thank you.

## Government 2nd
Opposition decided to take a strategic approach when they decided it was okay for them to neglect the bulk of the argument the Prime Minister brought to you. We say on our side, if we prove that the material we provided were relevant enough, as well as proof that they haven't sufficiently refuted our points, we say we should take this debate.

I'm going to give some rebuttals before I reconstruct the Prime Minister's material. The first thing to note, just on account of their model, is that they haven't been able to distinguish between what a tiger parenting and parenting is. On our side, we explicitly told you the importance of elephant impairing, where we prioritized the freedom of the child, and I explained the importance later, but the problem of Opposition is that they simply gave a one-liner about parents having the ability to choose something because they know society and they already study it.

There's two problems. First, is that given that it's true, I don't understand how that kind of analysis of tiger parenting is different from normal parenting. I want the DLO to come up here and explain the exclusive benefits that tiger parenting brings. 

Secondly, is that we kind of deny that premise, because I don't think tiger parents are more knowledgeable than other parents. We think that if a child wants to be an actor, a tiger parent won't know anything about it because their only interest is about academics, finding a good job, and finding a good future. We think in these cases, you're oppressing your child's future for the sake of academics, and we don't think this is something just.

I'm going to get a few things in my speech in. First, I'm going to prove to you why this is just. Secondly, I'm going to move on to my positive matter.

Let's look at whether this is just. We think that, as Prime Minister touched upon, we think that the government can intervene given there's a very foreseeable tangible harm. That's why the government is justified in implementing policies like mandatory education, because without education, society will collapse, and we also ban things like child neglect and child abuse because of the sake of the practical harms that are imposed to children. We think that on our side, I'm going to prove to you why there are tangible harms, because we think that in our world, the children are rather capable of making independent decisions. The problem of tiger parenting is that they lock that skill up where they force the children to become dolls and become slaves to the dreams that parents were unable to do.

That's why it was important for LO to refute the material the PM brought to you, which was that they ignore the free will of the child and they deprive opportunities of child. We think that the importance of the child wanting to play the piano or having friends, it may not necessarily be the practical outcomes of playing the piano, but what's important is the fact and the action that these children have the independence and have the capability of thinking for themselves and deciding that they want to do it.

Why is this so important? Because we think that we should prioritize the children's freedom over parental rights in these cases. Why? Because we think when we look at cases like where we condemned parents who are against LGBTQ children, we think rather now, we're fine and we're accepting of children who are able to make rational decisions by themselves. The problem of tiger parenting is that they don't grant any kind of free will or independence where we force parents to have authority to look after their children as their dolls. We don't think that's the kind of future children want either.

We think that based on that, we think it is just for the government to intervene in terms of practical matter. We say it is just because we think that it hinders the development of the children's growth as well as any kind of independence, but I'll talk about that in my positive matter. Therefore, the conclusion of the first half of my speech is that we think it is just because there are practical harms where we have to prioritize the children's freedom. We think the LO failed in engaging with this material and we think the opposition already failed on this point.

Let me move on to my positive matter. My second substantive matter is going to probably directly engage with what DLO's substantive, which is the opposition's ideas about the importance of getting good jobs, for instance. The thesis of this argument is that children will be unable to gain good jobs and even if they do, this is going to result in negative outcomes. The premise of my argument is that the skills you possess at universities are built upon your early ages when you live with your mother as a 12-year-old.

Why is this? Because we say that in cases of universities or getting good jobs, these things are a natural extension of primary and secondary schools. So given this, what skills are needed to succeed in good universities and good jobs? We think this looks like things like the sense of independence as you're now going to be separated from the arms of your parents, right? We also think this looks like critical thinking, to be able to adapt to new changes and think rationally for ourselves. We think these are the skills you need and I'm going to prove to you why these skills are not going to be obtained. Before that, sure.

<POI> Why do you think that children who grew up in a tiger parenting household are not going to be independent when they go to university, where they have to be independent by themselves when they enter universities?

So it's like saying you're suddenly going to make a child suddenly go on a bicycle without any training wheels, right? We think that we need these kinds of training wheels for these children to think independently, but we don't think it's good when there's going to be a parent just pushing their child until they're able to ride a bike. We don't think that suddenly throwing them out is enough for them to prepare for the universities that, in your best-case scenario, they're going to get into.

But I'm going to prove to you more specifically, right? Because we think under tiger parenting, these skills are lost because these children were a soulless robot obediently just walking the path that parents led them to. We think that when the path disappears, in the case of universities, because they're probably going to be physically separated from parents, these children aren't unable to know how to walk the path, they're unable to know what to do.

We think this results in people failing to progress in universities as they don't possess the abilities or the qualifications to succeed. Therefore, this is going to result in the 18 years of your youth sacrifice, your hobbies, your funds, all kinds of sacrifice for any kind for nothing, right? We think this is a terrible investment considering the breach of the children's rights that opposition is suggesting. But even further, let's take your best-case scenario where they do gain good jobs, right? They're able to get in good corporate structures, executive positions.

We think in this case, what's going to happen is that these people are going to push the knowledge they gain onto their subordinates. So what you're going to happen or have bosses with like diehard spirits, not letting people do what they think, because they're just going to be possessed by the kind of knowledge they gained when they were young, that you should just like, you should let me have authority.

## Opposition 2nd
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. Two issues from the Deputy Prime Minister. Firstly, the Tiger Parliament expands the children's choice. A parent is an actor to let the children able to live in the society. Secondly, we talk about the disproportionate risk that children are sitting exposed to for child education. A parent is difficult to teach the necessary things for the children.

Before that, several rebuttals to the Deputy Prime Minister. Lastly, they talk about how the children's freedom is deprived by the Tiger Parliament. But, ladies and gentlemen, we think the freedom of the children is not so important in the past. The reason is very simple. The children are not responsible in the society. If the children are committed a crime, the parents also take responsibility for the victim. For example, if the children are robbed of something in the shop, the parents have to compensate for the disturbance. That's the reason why the children are living under the protection of the parents. As long as the children are not independent of the parents, the freedom of the children is not so prioritized by the parenting.

Secondly, we talk about how the children are incapable of making decisions. And this policy is against the children. But, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the children cannot judge what is necessary for their living. Because they cannot have the experience of independence in society, also the children cannot earn money in the past. That's the reason why. As long as the children cannot be independent of the parents, the children cannot judge what is necessary for the children. That's why instead of the children, the parents have to educate the children. And this is so necessary. That's the reason why the children's decision is not important in the state. Okay. Taken.

<POI>How are Tiger parents comparatively better than other parents at making these decisions? 

Our boundary is not so that the Tiger parents are always good for their parents. The problem of the government bench is, if they ban the Tiger parents, it also makes this a chilling effect for the necessary parents. Because this line of the Tiger parents and the parents is very vague. If they ban the Tiger parents, also the Tiger parents are treated as child abuse. This problem makes sense. So, parents cannot take the necessary education for the children. That's why the burden of the government bench, while the situation is also justified. That's why our burden is not staying. So, Tiger parents are always good for their parents.

So, moving on to my first argumentation. Tiger parenting sometimes expands the children's choice. The reason is very simple. Parents cannot know what is necessary for the society if they live longer than the children. For example, the parents already experienced many success and failure in their life. Sometimes the parents are used to the raising, and they fail to enter the university. That time, parents think they want to prevent the children from failing by the Tiger parents. That's why we show, at least we show, this is necessary for the Tiger parents. If the kids are without the Tiger parents, sometimes the children continue to be raised. And the children also deprioritize their freedom. They also play with their friends. They just play on the piano. After that, the children regret the same as their parents, right? That's the reason why the Tiger parents are sometimes important. Because humanity is basically raised. Humanity is not always so stoic for themselves. That's why, as the guardian of the parents, guardian of the children, the parents sometimes are necessary for doing the Tiger parents.

Secondly, the important point is the analysis. This policy leads to a chilling effect for the child's education. The reason is very simple. The government doesn't explain what is the role of the Tiger parents in the necessary education. We think, also, we already banned many stoic education as child abuse. For example, the parents cannot love the children 24 hours in the home. Because it's one of the child's education. However, in so many extreme cases, it's already banned. However, after taking this proposal, some stoic education is also treated as a Tiger parenting. This is so unbeneficial for the parents. Because even if the parents love the children, however, if the parents are punished by the Tiger parenting, the parents cannot live with the children. Because the child abuse, one of the punishments of child abuse, parents have to live apart from the children. That's the reason why, in order to avoid this situation, they cannot teach stoically for the children. That is the sole problem of this policy.

Secondly, the parents cannot teach the necessary things for the children. The reason is very simple. Because the parents also cannot know this line of the Tiger parenting. Also, many of the third parties always supervise this parental action. If the children say, I always go to the discipline school, and they say, I don't like this studying, the parents force me to do studying. If some people hear this situation, they also sometimes have the opportunity to stand for the child protection center. Also, the child protection center can punish the parents in the first place. Even if the parents and the children love each other, this third party can't intervene easily. That is a very unbeneficial thing for both of the families in the first place. That's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, we think this policy is not so beneficial in terms of the feasibility point and in terms of the line of this Tiger parenting.

So that's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, as long as the government didn't explain this line of the Tiger parenting, the necessary parenting, we cannot ban the Tiger parenting. Ladies and gentlemen, we think that if this policy is not just a policy, that Tiger parenting does more harm than good. We think this policy is why the banning is the only way to reduce the child's education for the collective. You think we already saw that this is a necessary point of the Tiger parenting and the damage of the banning of the Tiger parenting, our point is already clear to the government. That's why we oppose the motion.

## Government 3rd
Judge, don't let side opposition run away with their easy burden, saying that they don't really have to prove that tiger parents are good. No, right? If we look at the motion, we're specifically trying to ban a certain thing, and if they can't prove that there's no, like, if they say that, if there's no reason to keep tiger parenting, then you should obviously vote for Gov, because the government is the one that is getting rid of that unnecessary thing, right? 

So opposition do have a burden to prove that tiger parenting uniquely brings some specific benefits to the child, which they haven't so far. We need opposition to clarify what they're trying to support, and why the side they're supporting is comparatively better than the normal parenting that we support, very proud to propose today. 

A couple of refutations to the previous speaker, before I get into clash. So firstly, they say that, um, so they say that, like, our burden is not to say that tiger parentings are good, etc, etc, but, like, in the end, if they don't even talk about the benefits of tiger parenting, then they don't have anything to protect on their side, right? So ultimately, in order for opposition to, like, potentially win the debate, they do have to explain to a certain extent why tiger parents are something necessary for the child's education, and why it's something that they need to protect. 

And the only thing they told us so far is that, oh, tiger parenting, like, because they failed themselves, like, they can, like, teach their child to, like, not, like, regret stuff, and, like, they can teach their child to be stoic and so on. But we don't see why parents have to, like, physically and both mentally, like, abuse their child to the extent that their, like, self-esteem is diminished, they're constantly being called worthless, they're constantly being told to believe that their classmates are enemies, they're constantly told to be top in class, and to always be studying 24 7. We don't see why this method is necessary for the child to be stoic.

I think, like, a simple encouragement, or, like, telling children about the importance of studying is enough for children to be motivated to work for their own passion. Because if children do have the independence that side opposition forgets, then children themselves are able to work hard for their own dreams, for their own future. That is why we never see why this specific forcing and brainwashing from tiger parenting is necessary for the child to be stoic. So overall, we don't see any benefit coming from side opposition so far. We need a response from WIP.

Secondly, they talked about how the line between, like, normal parenting and, like, tiger parenting is really vague. Therefore, we shouldn't take the plan. But no, right? Like, firstly, from the very Prime Minister, we told you three specific reasons of why tiger parenting are uniquely bad, right? Firstly, we told you that tiger parents ignore the free will of the child. So even if the child wants to be an actor, or wants to be a sports player, or wants to be any kind of dream job that they want to be, the tiger parent doesn't even let the child speak out. Because their goal is to make their child succeed and live a life that they couldn't live themselves. That is why they only prioritize academic success of their child, they neglect any kind of free will or opinion of their own child. We think that this is very harmful for the independence over the self-actualization and the overall long term happiness of the child. 

Secondly, we secondly told you that tiger parents deprived the opportunity of the child, right? This is like making sure that the child never has a chance to go out with friends, that they never have a chance to make their own hobbies and whatnot. All they have to do in their childhood is go to cram school, do piano, etc, etc. All those like cool, like, you know, those classes that they're forced to go. So we think that they don't have time to play, they don't have time to make relationships. We think that this is very crucial for the child's health, their mental health, and also for building your identity, right? Because your identity is built from your relationship with others. 

But tiger parents not only deprive the kids to go out with friends in the first place, they tell them that those friends out there in the classroom are their enemies, someone that they have to beat and test, someone that they have to beat in order to climb up the social ladder. This kind of wrong morality, skewed vision of the tiger parents is what deprives a child of having a happy social life. 

But more importantly, we told you that because tiger parents are so narrow-minded, and so desperate for their child's success, they ultimately use like harmful and very abusive words saying like, oh, you're worthless, or like, why can't you do this, etc, in order for the child to succeed. And we think that this puts like the wrong set of morals, as I told you before, and overall ignores the long term success of the child, because they think that, oh, as long as you can get into like a top university, like Harvard or Kodai, like everything is going to work out. That's their like narrow-minded, like a plan for their child. And we think that this is never good for the child.

Our second speaker told you that specifically what children need is independence and critical thinking. If they constantly follow the parents' plans about like, which cram school to go, which universities to go, what like subjects to study, then they will never gain this kind of like self-independence, like self-thinking skills, right? We think that this is especially harmful, because children are never going to be with their parents forever, they have to step out into society at some point. And even if they do get into like a very good university, or like a very good job, once they leave their parents' supervision, they wouldn't know what to do, right? 

So ultimately, even if we take side opposition's best case, is saying that the child does leave us with like a successful life in terms of with brand and career, they will never last. So even if they get into like a top university, what we would ultimately see is them falling apart, they wouldn't know what to do. Overall, we think that this is this would be this will not be a long term success of the child is something that we can never support.

Finally, this whole issue about whether tiger parenting or relying on the knowledge of other parents is discussed. Some argue that kids lack the knowledge to make decisions. We disagree; kids have access to schools, teachers, and the internet, providing ample resources to learn about their dream jobs. Additionally, we haven't seen evidence supporting the idea that tiger parenting is inherently better than other parenting styles. Therefore, in evaluating parents' capabilities, this argument should not be considered.

The leader of the opposition suggests that in the government's world, kids will be spoiled, and parents won't be able to discipline them. Let's consider the average parent. While they may allow their kids to play video games or socialize, they would discipline them if academic performance suffers or if the child becomes addicted to video games. This approach is part of average parenting, and it would still be allowed in the government's world. 

However, what we don't support is parents ignoring a child's desire to socialize, confining them to their rooms, enforcing late-night studying, and responding to lower test scores with harmful and abusive words that undermine the child's identity and self-esteem.

We assert that such harmful and abusive parenting practices should not be supported. Our stance is not an endorsement of every child becoming spoiled; rather, we propose the establishment of a third party, as suggested, to examine personal parenting styles and ensure the well-being of the child. This way, children can thrive, be happy, and succeed in the long term, forming the basis of our pride in this proposal.

## Opposition 3rd
I think that the one flaw coming from the government, and it's that they didn't show any workability within this version. They told us that tiger parenting is somehow a bad thing, but it didn't really show us why after taking this motion, the parents are suddenly going to change and going to stop tiger parenting. When it comes to domestic cases, we think that parents are still going to do tiger parenting to begin with. Within that, it doesn't really change the situation from two reasons.

Number one, we say that it's domestically happening. Same as domestic violence, because it is happening under your family, it's hard for the government to supervise all of those things. Unlike domestic violence, where your husband, your wife can run out and go to the police, when it comes to children, because they don't really have any knowledge about domestic violence or tiger parenting, they don't even know the fact that they are being tiger parenting and this is somehow illegal.

But number two, we say that because the harm that is being imposed if children are mild where it's a psychological harm compared to domestic violence or child abuse, which is a physical harm, it's unlikely for other people to find out to begin with. Secondly, we say that because it's a mild abuse, children don't really realize and don't really go to the police or other places and say that they are being tiger parenting. We think that it's unlikely for those parents to stop tiger parenting to begin with.

Secondly, we say that it's arbitrary. We've told you that the line between tiger parenting and normal parenting is completely arbitrary. And there are three criteria why it is uniquely bad? Even if it is uniquely bad, we don't think how they are going to define tiger parenting to begin with. We say that I'm just going to decide the amount of time that their children are going to study. We think that that's completely absurd. No, thank you.

Secondly, we say that we don't think that they have proven the BOP that they have to prove to begin with, because what they need to prove is not that to us, like to a certain extent it's harmful, but they have to prove all, or like 90 percent, it's most of the time harmful to children. We don't think that they have actually proven that BOP to begin with.

Three analyses to look at this debate. No, thank you. Number 1, in a principle way. Number 2, how it's going to be for their social interactive ability and last of all, talking about the academic ability that they are going to gain. First one, to a principle.

Somehow, the Deputy Prime Minister, I think that he didn't really have any strategy within the state to begin with, because the Deputy Prime Minister said that the practical outcome justifies this debate. Let's, if so, let's go with practical outcome. But then he said that the freedom of choice for children in itself is something important no matter the practical outcome. The Deputy Prime Minister proposed an example, LGBTQ plus and you shouldn't hinder the choice that that person has. The precise difference between LGBTQ plus and the difference between tiger parenting is that being LGBTQ plus isn't necessarily harmful. Well, without tiger parenting, without a lady child having any supervision, those children are going to have a bad practical outcome. We think that in terms of a principle argument, what they are just saying is that, consequently, what they are saying is that, let's compare with a practical outcome. So I'm happy to compare this debate within a practical outcome.

So number 2, how about the children's social interactive ability? So the Prime Minister told us that they need to have time to play with their friends. Number 1, I say that in general, even they are doing tiger parenting, obviously, they can get once a week to play with their friends. But even in the hard case where tiger parenting is imposing an everyday schedule, we say that there's an existence of school, right? When you go to school, they can at least play with your children without any supervision from your parents. You can go out to the play field during lunch break. We think that with school, you can guarantee the social interactive ability for children.

So let's go to the academic ability, which is one of the most important parts of this debate. So the side of the government gave us one-liner analysis as the children have irrationality. We don't think so from several reasons. 

Number 1, we told you that children most of the time are irrational, right? They don't really see the society. They don't know how society works. And we think that they are unable or incapable to decide what kind of ability they need in order to succeed or in order to do what they want to do in the society.

But number 2, we say that there's peer pressure from your friends, right? When you look at other youth friends playing in the park, you also want to play and join that part because you don't necessarily think that studying is as much important as playing with your friends, right? So we think that peer pressure would force you to play with other friends as well. 

And number 3, we say that principly, parents have the right to decide over children's ability in terms of medical treatment and civil court because they are under the supervision of parents, right? 

And the side government told us from the opposition and from the government that teachers and the internet would help those children. The point here is that they don't even have the idea of asking those things to their teachers or the internet, right? Without any kind of supervision from their parents, we don't think that children know what to ask their teachers to begin with, right? 

And secondly, we talked about how independence is going to be lost by Tiger parents. We say that children are gradually going to acquire independence to begin with because we don't think that Tiger parents are going to last for high schoolers, right? Children are gradually going to gain independence. And when they go out into high school, although they might be Tiger parenting, at least they can decide what kind of friends that they want to hang out with, what kind of subject that they want to study, what kind of university that they want to study, right? We think that Tiger parents often take place in elementary school or like junior high school to begin with, right? 

And secondly, we told you here that there weren't any practical outcomes that came from the side government, right? We think that this is something important in this day because they somehow want to compare this today on a practical level. We didn't show any kind of practical outcome that is going to be beneficial for children, right? We explicitly told you the benefit of tiger parenting exists because academic achievement is regarded as the primal success in the society. Children have the necessity to go out to go to a good university and to go to a good high school, right? And we say, we told you that most children are normal, right? They can't really decide anything by themselves. And we say that this analysis is the primary analysis for children with one disability.

## Opposition 4th
Okay, three failures from the government's side today. So, firstly, they talked about wrong things in this debate. Secondly, they have failed to refute our point. And thirdly, they made no engagement. So, I'll talk about those three things from one by one.

So first of all, we like to say that the government has been condemning tiger parents as if they are abusing children. The Whip government claimed that tiger parents say abusing words to children, or the Whip government told you how tiger parents brainwash children. We said that is different. The deputy leader, Opposition, told you how parents who experienced failure don't want their children to do the same thing. So, we told you, after all, tiger parents don't want to actively harm children, right? Because if parents actively harm children and narrow down their opportunities or narrow down their freedom of choice or whatever, that is called abusing, and that's out of this debate. Therefore, their point cannot be the voting issue here.

So, moving on to the second thing. This is about lazy children. We told you, we have proved that tiger parents are necessary in those cases. The Whip government claimed that we need a specific reason why tiger parents are uniquely good, and we did. 

So, we told you how lazy children are naturally lazy. They keep playing games and they don't have thoughts about their success or they don't have enough free will for their future, so they have no rebuttal for this point. The only rebuttal likely for this point is, oh, if children are playing video games, parents can't stop them from playing video games, and that's not called tiger parenting. This is so illogical here, because firstly, this actually supports our argument, because we told you, some children are lazy, so if the parents don't keep telling children to study or do something else, they wouldn't stop playing games, because that's what lazy means. 

Secondly, the other side is principally contradicting. They talk about how children are rational and have opinions as to what they want to do, but at the same time, the Whip government describes TV games as something that parents can stop if their children keep doing, and we don't understand that, because under this stance, parents have to respect children's freedom of will and let them play. But we told you how this is so problematic, and this harm is so tangible, so therefore, as the D Prime Minister said, we have tangible harm if we take this motion, therefore we mustn't take this motion.

So moving on to the third thing, why lazy children is the main issue in this debate? Because firstly, we told you that's necessary in terms of parental responsibility to children. We told you how parents who have experience than children have to make the choice instead of children, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition told you. 

And secondly, we say that the government side has been talking about their best case all the time. They narrowed down this debate by telling you that children have free will from the point of their birth. 

And so thirdly, we engaged to that point because we told you how children have at least some choice who to hang out with or what to watch. So therefore, it is clear that we must not take this motion.

## Government 4th
Just The Whip literally conceded that their own side has only like one fault, which was a minor case about feasibility. The opposition side only talks about the feasibility, but we don't think that this point is very strong. 

And secondly, we don't think the practical, like the enormous harm, which is going to outweigh our harm, that we talk about the paragraph parenting in their point, so we think that this point is very weak, that they should never take in this point. 

But moreover, the opposition side of The Whip has a lot of late arguments or justifications. Like they said, we should judge things like in the court, or the individual should have something like, the individual can have some kind of choices in high school, but they never told some kind of logic of this. And moreover, we think that it's too late talking in this debate, so this is late argument, so just please don't take it.

Okay, I'd like to go to our comparison. Okay, well firstly, this debate is very simple. Well, the opposition side never told like how benefit it's going to happen by doing tiger parenting or like that, so we think that because of this, there is not this kind of benefit gained by this tiger parenting. 

We think that the benefit is too small for it, but what the proposition side told you is that there is a lot of kind of harm, which is going to, which they never engage, so we think that this point is very strong, it's going to happen in our paradigm, so we think that comparing these two harms, or like these benefits, we think that our point is ending.

Okay, let's see in the micro cases. Okay, firstly, we'd like to talk about which side can lead children to the better future. Alright, so they always say that they can have a better future by having like good jobs or big like academic skills or like that, but we never, we actually engage on this point by saying that alright, well maybe they can go to this like big corporation, but it's normal that you're going to be fired by bad human relationship or communication with your boss or co-workers and not, cannot be promoted in the society, rather you're going to quit this kind of job. These things are happening in the society. We think that there is this kind of like benefit is very little, and moreover, this is not good for these children, right?

So how our side can lead better future for it? Well firstly, we're going to say that by banning this kind of like tiger parenting, we're going to say that the individuals can have the choice or like the time that they're going to think about this future. If you're going to have tiger parenting, you don't have any kind of time which you're going to think about the future. For example, if you're in high school, you're going to say, oh please go to, you have to go to Todai. If you're not going to Todai, you're not like a human or like that, or like what these kind of tiger parenting is too pressuring these children, and we think that it is harming a lot. 

However, if we're going to ban this, we think this freedom is going to be gained to these people, right? So this, we think that the students are going to think about what kind of like university or like jobs they want to have in the future, and we think that it's going to be the better one. How is it so? Because firstly, we say that we can have the aim that we're about studying or like that, right? Then secondly, we say that because the individual is going to have like the passion that they want to do it, we think that it's going to be the better future. And moreover, because certainly we think that individuality is going to be made, so we think it is better than their paradigm, which these children are being dependent on these parents or like that, and they can never think about like others or like that.

Okay. Secondly, we'd like to compare their point by saying that which kind of, which role should be like prioritized. Well, they always say that the parents are very rational or like that, but we're just saying that our side is going to support elephant parenting, right? These parents are going to put the children's individual choices, try to see children to have a better future by giving choices, right? Because we say that the children are going to like have like passion or like other things, we think that we can lead to a better future. That is actually why we're going to propose. Thank you.
