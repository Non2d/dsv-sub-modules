However, the Opposition 2nd did not directly address this clarification and continued to argue for the media's role in checking corruption without specifically engaging the Government's differentiation between public and private actions.

3. **Government 3rd vs Opposition 3rd**:
   - The Government 3rd speaker highlighted a lack of direct engagement by the Opposition on the argument of politicians’ lack of consent regarding their private life being exposed. However, the Opposition 3rd did not effectively respond to this point and instead continued to push the narrative of the public's right to know, without directly addressing the Government's consent argument.

4. **Opposition 4th vs Government 4th**:
   - The crux of the Opposition's final argument seemed to rest on the idea that moral failures can be hidden by politicians without media scrutiny, but they did not directly counter the Government’s point about the separation of public and private actions and the existing channels to expose actual malpractices. Meanwhile, the Government 4th did attempt to refute the Opposition's points but did not seem to engage fully with the Opposition's assertions about the media's role in preventing the concealment of failures.

Overall, both teams addressed some opposing points but left several key arguments inadequately addressed, indicating a level of parallel argumentation.

# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #15 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

# Debate Transcripts
## Government 1st
We agree that politicians have the power to change society through policies, but what we don't agree is the politicians becoming public property, where every single action is determined by the public, where the paparazzi is justified in walking around and, for instance, hacking into their phones and looking at private documents for the sake of their own profit. We think it is inherently unjust for the media to try and pry into the private lives of politicians at the expense where they could potentially have children or families who didn't consent to these behaviors. So I'm very happy to propose. 

Let me start off by explaining our stance. Three parts. First, is that we would define private lives as the world in which these politicians or members that are part of the private lives didn't give consent to. Realize that this is inherently different from public lives, which is literally their job as a politician, so we think that private lives are inherently the elements of life that are irrelevant to one's action of doing a job. 

And secondly, we would define media as anything that looks like social media, we think it could look at any kind of newspaper or magazine, we think it doesn't matter. 

And thirdly, is that we think that in instances of corruption, these are instances that are involved in security, and this is an issue that is involved in their own jobs as a politician, so we think in the case of corruption, we think that's kind of irrelevant to this debate, so we think that in those instances, that's basically a public matter for society.

So we think opposition really needs to defend the micro nuances of private lives, for instance, of which newspaper they walk to, or what house, where they live, or what kind of house they live in. That's the kind of comparison we want to make.

Given this, I'm going to bring you two arguments. First, I'm going to explain to you why politicians have a right to private lives, and secondly, I'll be explaining why this is bad for public discourse. 

First, let's look at why politicians have a right to private lives. Two reasons. First, is because we think that this is just a natural reaction of the rights we give. Because if you look at the status quo, politicians are given some certain extent of protection. For instance, they have the right to property, that is that we don't allow people to access their bank accounts or invade someone's house. Why? Because we think this is information that is inherently only relevant and important to that specific person, and people around them don't have a right to know it. 

What does this suggest? This suggests that this motion is just a natural extension of the rights we give. For instance, we think that there is no justification or any kind of need for the public sphere to know which politician goes out to eat with, what kind of things they do with their children or their family, and we think that it is unjust for the media to just pry on specific and wavy information for the sake of their own. 

We think it is just in saying that these politicians should be able to live a life where they don't have to fear paparazzi escaping around, at the point in which we already give certain rights. We think this is just a natural extension, we see no problem. 

But B, is because politicians never consented to this in the first place, right? Because we think the private lives are inherently elements of life that these politicians didn't give consent to, right? At the point in which we infringe consent, even at the bypass of one instance, we say this is a slippery slope, with at the moment in which the media can infringe upon the consent of an individual, we allow the media, for instance, barge into houses or looking at private documents of a policy, and we think this is never justified, and at the moment in which we should never cross the line of consent. 

But let's take the best case scenario of politicians, that is that politicians don't really care about their private lives, so we should be able to do whatever we want to do. Even if politicians still gave some consent, we think that it's still not legitimate. Why? Because we think that other factors and other variables are included in private lives, who didn't consent to this in the equation. For instance, it could look like family members, or friends, or children who didn't agree to having their every single action being exposed by the media. 

We think that it is inherently justified to not report on the private lives when there are third-party harms. We think it is unjustified for a politician's wife to be surrounded by cameras every single day asking about a potential scandal of a politician, where innocent children are trying to be asked by popularity every single day of how they think their dad is, right? We think that those kind of third-party harms, at the point in which they didn't consent to these kind of behaviors in the first place, we think the media never has a justification. 

Given that politicians have a right to private lives, why should this override the authority of the media? Which is probably going to be the argument coming from opposition. Two reasons. First, is that we think that the role of media should not be provoking or inciting these kind of issues in the first place. Why? Because we think the media should be news that just shows reliable information and not try to create some fake news in the first place. 

We think that what's going to happen in the status quo is that these medias are going to be profit-incentivized and they're going to sensationalize issues. So we're very able to see situations where these media or newspapers are going to aggravate a politician and broadcast them in a very false way and try to incite violence and portray these politicians as someone that is radical or sexist or homophobic. 

Realize that these private issues of sensationalization are different from public issues like corona or murder because these issues are inherently public. And these public issues mean that it's very easy for the public to say, to see if this is fake or not. But the problem of this sensationalization of private lives is that there's no other source to determine the credibility. So that means that the public is only able to trust that piece of unreliable source and take it as true. So even if a politician is not racist or homophobic, if a media tries to broadcast their private lives as being racist, then everyone believes the politician is racist and we think that's inherently evil. 

But B, we think the private lives are irrelevant to the public actors, public actions of politicians. We think that as a politician, you do have a duty to give good policies and cater for society. But we think that what they do at home, their own actions and private lives are irrelevant to the public matters. 

Given this, we think the public doesn't have the justification to have access to private lives because whatever these politicians do in private is absolutely irrelevant to the actions of politicians do in public. Given this, we say the privacy outweighs authority of media.

My second argument is that this is going to be bad for political discourse. What does this mean and why is this the case? Because first, we would have two reasons. 

First is because we think that there are many instances where politicians want to keep something secret to maintain fairness. What does this mean? Because we think that the world we're going to see if media reports on the private lives of politicians is that if a politician is trying to gain votes, despite being very fair and equal, what's going to happen is that if they're found to be homosexual, they're going to lose votes in very conservative communities. We think this is bad because we think that we're going to have fair politicians being kicked out of office just by some racial bias. We think that those kind of issues are unjustified for the sake of political discourse. 

We think that politicians should have a right to act in a good public sphere. And we think that what their own self-identity shouldn't be bashed out for the sake of the public. 

But secondly, is that politics is going to be a dirty game. That is, the politician is just not really going to care about the policies they make, but rather just try to make a good persona and a personality for the sake of the state. 

And but secondly, what's going to happen furthermore is that these politicians are just going to try to throw dirt at other politicians, saying that some politicians committed adultery, even if it's not true, saying that one politician is racist. We think that inherently, politicians should just care about the policies they make and not about that behavior they do in private. 

Given this, we think that this is going to be bad for political discourse because politicians are now going to have an incentive to not care about policies, but rather to just shut down competition for other politicians. Given this, we think politicians have a right to private lives. They're no different from us. We think they should be able to live in peace. I'm very happy to propose.

## Opposition 1st
As the opposition side, in the age distinction between personal lives and political lives of positions is becoming unclear and like in the age where government has control over other related institutions. We think that media is the only way to prevent corrections and achieve real democracy. First of all, we'll talk about why it is justified. And secondly, we will talk about how those reports are critical for democracy.

So first of all, we say that they have talked about the traffic privacy rights for the politicians, but we have several responses.

First of all, we say that politicians can always sue media if they feel that media reported something so terrible, but we say that that decision should not be up to the government; whether media should report that information should be decided by courts, not the government itself because the government can always sue, like personal lives and exploit it to protect politicians who are committing corruptions. So we're not completely taking away private privacy rights.

Second of all, we say that medias have no incentive to disclose personal information of people around politicians because what people are interested in is what politicians do or whether the politicians are morally good or not. So, point you can always like put A or B instead of reporting the real name of my politician's friends or family, or like they can always sue. Instead of reporting the real name of my politician's friends or family, or like they can always put some mosaics on the face of the families of politicians. 

We're saying that those concerns of the government are not going to be real but even if we take the best case of the government's light and say that like media sensationalizes like sexual identity oppositions and like elections are going to be biased, we don't think like that's the reason to support this motion.  For example, already in elections, women are being discriminated, right? Because they put their names. They put their faces. And that's enough for people to know that they're women and they're being discriminated. We don't think this is a unique problem to this reporting personal rights.

And moreover, we say if that one politician turned out to be LGBTQ like he might. He or she might lose the votes from non-LGBTQ supporters but he will gain votes from LGBTQ supporters and we don't think this is better for discourse.

Moving on to the second argument, how it is good for democracy. So first of all, I'll start by capitalizing media. The first thing we say amongst the institutions that are able to disclose influence about politicians, for example, such as government itself or police, etc. Media is the most far from government, which means that media is least likely to be controlled by the government, like we can see that like court is already being controlled by government, and it is easy to say that all the other organizations are going to be controlled by the government.

Second of all, what media point about politicians? Two things, first of all, they report whether they are moral. For example, they might report that the politician is committing DV to his wife or something. Then the people will know that those politicians are not eligible to talk about women's rights in parliament or like in the recent example, we can see that media reported that Mr. Kurokawa went out during quarantine and that can help people know that policymakers don't care about the role point they make.

And second of all, they report connections between politicians. For example, like Mr. A and Miss B went out to a secret dinner party at like the western sea. This is something that is doubtful. Of course, politicians themselves will claim this is personal life and this is what the government side has said. But how like you don't know when like those personal dinner parties turn into political like corrupting meeting, right? So it is in so-called personal meetings that all the connections begin. So like after all, no one can plan a scheme in the official government building, right? So it's likely that politicians are exploiting world personal lives to actually do corruptions.

So what is it is like in the opposition side's world? So first of all, people can know about politicians' corruptions or morality and this is critical for like rational judging and voting because this is important because democracy is about receiving enough necessary information and voting. And we say that those morality of politicians is a critical information for that, because politicians are someone who represents people. 

And if the politician force people some kind of moral obligation or law and but they themselves don't conform it, we can say that politicians are just enjoying privilege by being politicians. Meaning they're just receiving money and pretending to be helping people and people know that those politicians don't care about people they're responsible. they don't care about what people will suffer or like people will benefit from their policies. If so no one will want to vote for them, right?

But in the government side as well because no one will disclose the information about morality or corruption people can't know about this and if the government's if this motion is taken the worst thing more worse things gonna happen because the government can always threaten media saying that hey, this is personal lives. Don't report this. So corruption is going to be more income under their world. So therefore we are proud to oppose.


## Government 2nd
Let's be very clear about what this debate is about, because this debate is not about a politician who has raped tens of women, because those are crimes and those are likely to be already prosecuted by the state. We think that the sort of politicians that are likely to be the main context of this debate are the ones who have committed adultery, for instance, or who have hidden the fact that they are homosexual in an extremely conservative area where they have the danger of being beaten up in the street and being the subject to conversion therapy. Those are the people we are protecting in this debate, and those are the people that the opposition, at the start of this debate, have ignored.

So, I'm going to introduce our third substantive, which is how we increase the quality of political discussion inside the parliament, but before moving on, I have a number of responses to the side of the opposition.

Firstly, the leader of the opposition says that this is justified because governments can, like on our side of the house, governments can redefine what the private life is, to effectively protect politicians who are corrupted. That's not the case, because this debate is not about state preventing media from doing something, because this is a value judgement debate, and this debate should be based on objectively whether or not media should do X, right? So this is clearly out of this debate.

But then they say, oh, the corruption is going to happen on our side of the house. But the important thing we need to note here is that we don't need to infringe on the privacy of politicians, we don't need to know what they're doing, whether or not they are committing adultery, in order to check what the money for the governmental subsidy to a political party has been used, right? We think that those are the public lives, which the media can legitimately check on the side of the politician, right? So there's always a check and balance system that exists on our side of the house. So clearly, that is out of this debate.

But then they say, in case of the infringement of privacy for families, we can always have mosaic. First of all, I think we have made this clear from the start of this debate, that media is likely to sensationalize at the point where it is actually beneficial to publish the very private lives of politicians, right? Because this is slippery slope, at the point where media is allowed to report whether or not some individual have committed adultery in the past is the point where they are likely to also publish the picture of them in the prom in high school, for instance. And then this extent goes on and goes on and goes on. So I think that eventually, in the long run, media will no longer have mosaic on your side of the house. But plus, you don't have a fear to say that the media is going to do this.

Secondly, because the fact that people, for instance, in conservative, extremely conservative area, know that this politician is a homosexual, it's not just about that they're going to lose votes, but it's also the question of survival. That is to say that even in the liberal context of the United States, there are 160 cases reported of conversion therapy, which is extremely traumatic for the homosexual individual. 

Now, the reason why those politicians hide their own identity in the first place is because they think it's worse for those individuals. So precisely, precisely by that logic, I think that the vast majority of context in this debate is a homosexual individual in conservative area, not in liberal area, because if those individuals are in liberal area, they would have presumably already come out of the closet as the leader of the opposition say that they can get more LGBT votes, right? So precisely for that logic, I think that it's false.

But then they say, so again, on the weird and coward response that we got from the leader of the opposition about how LGBT candidates can get votes from LGBT individual. This is already responded by two response; conversion therapy plus in conservative area. 

But then they say, oh, this is a critical information for democracy. But they have never explained to us why an immoral politician can't pass a law that criminalizes sexual harassment, if that's what people want, right? The ability for politician to fairly represent the view of individual, view of citizen is independent of whether or not they have committed adultery in the past, right? 

I think we can make it very clear, because I think what matters is how those politicians act in the public sphere, which is exactly the information that currently people can assess, right?For instance, I think that it's very clear that the voters have dozens of opportunities to interact with politicians in real life and face-to-face, right? Local community, so for instance, in the United States, politicians approximately spend more than 60% of their working hours going to supporters house and going to community center and interact with the voters, right, in order to get the crucial voter in order to be re-elected in the next election. 

So there are plenty of opportunities for those individuals who are genuinely caring about politics to be able to interact with politicians, thus being able to know about the very minor details of those individuals, right? The distinction we have to draw is that whether or not those politicians have actually consented to this disclosure of information, that is a crucial point we're making in this debate.

But finally, I want to add one thing to our argument about politics, right? One layer of mechanism as to why media is likely to use this tactic, so debunk the private lives of politicians, of opponents of politicians, actually. For instance, conservative media actively marginalizing liberal side of politicians in order to get the politics to be more conservative, right? 

So why is this a powerful tool for media to effectively marginalize politicians? Because there's a confirmation bias. For example, when a media broadcasts a picture of a politician who advocates to support the poor, wearing the thousand dollar suit in their vacation, for instance, even if that picture was photoshopped, for instance, people are going to effectively and immediately tie that politician with the image of being greedy at the point where that image is planted in people's mind, subconscious mind, is a point where even if that politician says that it's not true, it's a photoshopped picture, it seems like a pathetic attempt for that politician because you are a bad guy from the eye of the public. 

So I think we can all be clear that there are perverse incentives for media organizations, actually, especially conservative media organizations, to actively disenfranchise the liberal side of politicians and vice versa. So I think the politics is not going to focus on the policy and what the good for the society actually is, but more of the personal side of each politician and the image control, and it's going to be a really dirty game. 

So on to first, how it increases the quality of political discussion. I think we made it clear that the premise of this argument is that politicians' ability and how good a politician is at their job is independent from their personal life and how they act in the private sphere. And with that in mind, I think that the competitiveness of the job of politician is likely to increase on our side of the house for two reasons.

Firstly, it's because being a politician, there are already a lot of hurdles on being a politician. For instance, the responsibility that comes with it or potential backlash that you're likely to get. The fact that media actively debunks private lives of politicians means that there will be more disincentive for people not to become politicians. 

Secondly, it increases the accessibility of people to become politicians because people who have committed something immoral, maybe, can't be a political candidate immediately in the first place. 

So this increase in competitiveness means that we get politicians who better represent the will of the people. That means we get a far better form of democracy on our side of the house. For that reason, we want to protect the privacy of politicians. We want the politics to be better on our side of the house. Very proud to propose.

## Opposition 2nd
We believe that the most important thing in politics is preventing collapse by raising the politician's consciousness, and media in itself have rights to report what is related to your public interest and is helpful for citizens to electing politicians.

So before moving to my argument, I'm going to refute to the government side. So what the government side said is that there is no legislation to report the politician's private life because there is no consent and also includes your family members, but this is not true because under the status quo, media itself does not report your really private life. What the media is doing is, like, because media is not reporting, like, his children go to some surgeon's school or something, or he is dating with someone, media is not reporting such kind of thing because this is not related to the citizen's interest.

And what media report is a private thing but relating to the policy to some extent. So, for example, like, some politicians are appealing to certain authority or certain private company members, or like, he or she had a trip in disastrous situations or such kind of thing, but we think people have the right to know because we think that people have the right to know the beginning of corruption, and media have the right to report those kinds of things.

Second part is that, like, homosexual politicians will be attacked by non-LGBTQ supporters, but we think media will not disclose this kind of really sexual thing because media have never disclosed such kind of thing, and also media will not discriminate those politicians because if media does discriminate because they are LGBTQ, there will be a lot of criticism by citizens, because many people see media and people, there are many people who support LGBTQ, and those people will really criticize those media, and then media lose credit. So media have no incentive to discriminate those kinds of people

And even if media disclose those kinds of, report those kinds of points, they earn a lot of supporters, the politicians will earn a lot of supporters. Because for example, under the status quo, Komeito is supported by Soka Gakkai, it is a religious institution, community, but that's why, that's why Komeito have a lot of powers, and what I wanna tell from this example is those who have the same thoughts, or who have the same religious, or who have the same sexual thoughts, will be supported, will be strongly supported by the same group.

So, moving on to my argument, so first of all, I'm gonna talk about politicians will be conscious, and second of all, media have rights. 

So first, we believe politicians should be the good role model, good, good acting model for citizens, because the politicians should, are elected by citizens, and politicians have to keep the rule, so the voting owns your private life, you make them more conscious about their behavior, also private life reflects your personality, so people are easily understood by citizens, or you'll easily understand their personality, their candidates, or like, their politics, politics personality, larger than government. 

Firstly, why knowing personality is important, people are like, because people have to elect, or people have rights to elect politicians, so, because, and, it is, our, really, democracy.

<POI> So, why is interacting with that political candidate from your local voter bloc insufficient, knowing whether or not that person is actually trustworthy for individuals who genuinely want to participate in the world of politics? 

Because what people have to know about their personality, is because then people can decide who he or she is worth of credit, or something.

So moving on to my speech. So, in government paradigm, people lose the chance to know about those kinds of personality, your personality, and people have, people have rights to know that in order to choose, choose their lawfully person for the parliament, parliamentary.

 And second of all, people can know about the faction in each party or know about advocation with certain people or private companies. It is significant because on this data pool, many politicians, some politicians giving money illegally, or prioritizing their friend's company, but this, without media, people can't, people can't know about them, and police will not search this kind of thing because what police do is some accident happens, or some people witness some accident, and then they're going to research.

But media is not, it's not doing such kind of thing because media will be more flexible to those kinds of things. And in the government paradigm, since the media can't report their private life, citizens will lose the chance to know that, and because media lose incentive to research about that, so politics will be collapsed in government power line.

And so in our paradigm, we can achieve, we can stick together who are highly motivated politicians, who are willing to be good model for a person, like keeping those are morally good person. So, so for these reasons, we are happy to propose, thank you.

## Government 3rd
Opposition's stance in saying that the distinction between private and public lives is very unclear is not a substitute and not a justification for the media to be able to report on every single action of politicians. 

I'm going to examine two areas of clash. First, does the media have justification? And secondly, I'm going to look at the effects on politics.

First, let's look at whether media has justification. And let me number out what opposition really talked about, but it realized in the first place that opposition never really gave a constructive argument, but most of their talk was basically built upon rebuttals to our constructive. So if we mitigate the rebuttals, we say at the moment in which they don't have any constructive impact to fall back on, we say that we should win this debate.

A is that first the problem with what opposition first told us is the distinction between media and government, because there's somehow stance coming from leader of opposition was that, hey, that governments like governments should not be able to report on the private lives of politicians, but media can because media is more reliable than the government. This is an absurd argument to come up with because in terms of authority, governments is the ones that are passing policies that are giving laws that say that these politicians have a right to privacy. So the moment in which opposition is willing to concede that the government doesn't have authority to report on the private lives, and we say similarly, just in terms of authority, the media should similarly not be able to report on private lives.

But B is that they refuted against our argument saying that these other individuals involved aren't really related because one, we have a mosaic, and two, that media has no incentive to do so. Realize that in the first place, they never refuted our main premise about politicians themselves not giving consent. Opposition needs to engage with this main crux because this was an argument that was a sub nuance of our main argument. They need to say why even if politicians didn't give consent to, why the media is justified in doing so.

But let's take their best of consent to other individuals. Notice that you're only able to determine whether a politician is, quote, quote, coming from opposition is good or morally a good person, morally capable person, is through interpersonal relationships. That means that you need to know how they behave through their relationships with other people, how they treat other members of society. And in order to find that out, then inevitably you need to report on the private lives of other members that are in the sphere of the private lives of politicians. Given this, we think that these other individuals didn't give consent, and we think the media has no perverse incentive to only look at the politicians themselves.

But B, notice that when they talk about mosaic, that's not really, that's a really weird stance to take by. Because if their stance was that, hey, the public and private lives is becoming very unclear, so we should be justified in like breaking that apart, then if they're okay with just simply going with mosaic, I don't really see why the media won't be justified in not reporting on mosaic or hiding up names. And I think, rather, if they're saying that security should be maintained to some certain extent, I don't know why it cannot go, why it cannot go to the extent where media should not report on the private lives of any instances. The moment in which you draw an unclear line is the moment in which opposition will still be.

But lastly, most importantly, is that they said that, hey, this is okay in the case of preventing corruption. This argument is the most absurd but most important thing I want you to know in my speech. That is that I think it's extremely disrespectful to substitute minor cases and categorize all politicians as potentially being corrupt or someone that commits adultery. Because their logic was that, hey, that if no one is looking, then these politicians are going to be able to do whatever they want to do. Look, people won't commit domestic violence just because you have the capability of doing so. We say politicians in general are usually good people who care for society. That's literally the reason why they become politicians, because they want to create policies and make people happy. So it's important to note that opposition's label of all politicians are bad is bad.

But secondly, this, what they're suggesting as a policy is analogous to, for instance, these people might be committing a crime, so let's invade their house and check. Look, realize that people are proven innocent until guilty, and this is something that is intuitively correct because we can't just suddenly label a person as guilty without evidence. What they are suggesting is in sake of a potential crime, then we should be able to infringe upon privacy, their consent. 

And we think this is extremely bad because this is going to lead to a slippery slope in a line where the media can do whatever they want to do for some baseless potential of crime. We kept on talking about, and this clashes directly with our arguments about political discourse, because we think it's important that the media should never be able to just do whatever they want to do because of some hypothetical myth that these people have created themselves. 

Given this, media has no justification, but at the moment in which they never engage with their material about how they never gave consent and that they already have a given certain protection in terms of, for instance, like privacy, in terms of bank accounts or house. We think opposition never really was able to engage this. And at this moment, we say the media has never a justification.

But secondly, let's look at the effects on politics. The first thing that opposition suggested was that, hey, that if we expose the identity of politicians, then they might lose some like supporters from non-LGBT, but they'll gain support from LGBTQ members. I think it is important to note that the media should not be the actor that determines what is good for the politicians, because on our side, we're very happy for politicians to come out and expose their identity if they think it's good for them. 

But we don't think that the media is justified in substituting the politicians' opinions and forcibly exposing the identity, especially in instances of conservative communities, the examples that we told you, because this simply is unjust. I think it is important that opposition is the one that is suggesting that the media should always be the one that determines what politicians want. 

I think the politicians should have some certain choice of whether they want to expose their identity of their own.

But B, is that their characterization of role model. I have two responses. First is that I don't really see the need for politicians becoming role models in the first place, because politicians are not social influencers that determine what kind of people, like the best ideal person that a normal citizen wants to be. Because we think that the inherently job and the point of a politician is to create policies and laws that are good for society. So there's really no need for the general public to have a politician as a role model. And we think that this isn't a justification for the media to report in the first place.

But B, is that let's take them at their best and that there are individuals that cater, they want to become like these politicians. We think in those instances, that's still capable on our side. Like the POI that Kotaro gave to DLO, that was that we have enough opportunities to engage for these individuals, such as local voting blocs, because you see politicians walking around in the streets and seeing what they are like. I think that's enough of these politicians to act. And I think that that again, is not a substitute for a constructive argument for opposition.

And lastly, is the case about corruption. I think it is important to note that we already said in our model that corruption, domestic violence is irrelevant in this debate in the first place, because those are public issues related to criminal law. And it's important that opposition can't really defend these cases because that's simply out of the debate.

Lastly, I want you to note the lack of engagement because there was never a response coming to you about how there's going to be worse or politicians and politicians becoming basically a competition of throwing dirt like Trump did to Hillary in elections for Pizzagate. I think it is important to note the politicians are going to be severely worse on their opposition side. I'm very happy to propose.

## Opposition 3rd
We have a right to watch the politicians behave and are certain whatever that behave is whether that behave is appropriate or not because society always stands on democracy and democracy is also made by electing or supporting by citizens.

I'm going to move on to the rebuttal. First, the goevrnment side said that "to report private life of politivians is not justified, because this information is very private, and to judge this so difficult." but LO defined that the private lives are not like where they live or something. These pieces of information are uncomfortable for us. And in this debate, we talk about more relevant to citizens and police and relevant to policy. And this is also relevant to people. And the people, the people considering got the point of democracy. 

And this also causes social discourse. I'm going to talk about this later. And about the LGBT issue. If politicians say discriminative things about LGBTQ, media can report, and this also causes social discourse. 

And so I'm going to reconstruction of our side. We have the right to know about government information so that we can make our lives better. And in the election, to change governments, the part of politicians' behavior, we should know the worst part of politicians' behavior. If we know about it, we have to restart. We don't know that because we can't believe him, and we can't entrust him with government managing point.

And these days, now coronavirus spread all over the world. This situation is very serious, and the government requested them to stay home. But in this situation, if a politician travels somewhere with his or her family, this is personal information, but media should report to us because this is involved with citizens, and citizens can't ascertain whether the behavior is appropriate or not. 

In this example, everyone may think that we can't trust him and we can't entrust him to manage member government. So to report personal life of a politician is also to give social discourse to society. So this is the benefit by taking this motion.

And to report personal life of a politician is to give social discourse, and so if we take this motion, we can give social discourse to society. And this also makes there's a better government by standing on democracy. So, we shouldn't take this motion, thank you.

## Opposition 4th
As the leader of the opposition reply, we would like to strongly oppose this motion. Firstly, we will have another look at the constructive matters in the debate. And after that, we will talk about the main clash in this debate.

So the first thing of construction is why our side's capitalization of politicians is just. So the government side has talked about how to claim that the opposition side is characterizing politicians as bad people. But we don't, but they missed our nuance. Because what we are saying is that politicians are just in the environment that their moral failures can be concealed by governmental power over other institutions. We are not saying that politicians' personal, like principles, personality is corrupt. We think that they are just in the environment that makes politicians' failure invisible.

So, second of all, they have talked about how discourse is going to be confused. But their argument was weak. Because as the opposition pointed out, media can work both ways. It is wrong to say that media only commit outing or like make sensations in a bad way. 

Media can make sensations in a good way also. As the opposition side can say, media can report offensive statements towards the LGBTQ community or whatsoever. And we say that merely the fact that media can work in a good way is enough to justify the reporting of personal life of politicians. Because in case that media caused bad sensations, then as we have already said, politicians can sue media or something like that. 

But what we hear is like the situations where politicians have complete control over what they make public about their principles and like concealing the biases that they themselves have.

So, moving on to the main class of today, it is whether like personality can be the criteria of judgment in voting. So, we are weighing the privacy rights of politicians and weighing the rights for the people to know about the personality of the politicians. So, we can compare these two in terms of whether we have an alternative to protect that actor. 

We already said that no one other than media is willing to report about politicians' wealth failures. And the only response we got was that people can interact personally with the politicians. But do you think that politicians will say offensive things in front of their daughters? No. And we don't think also that people are willing to interact with every single politician. 

And compared to that, in case of privacy rights, we have already shown how we can minimize that harm or how politicians can sue media. That's why our arguments outweigh their arguments. We are more than happy to oppose.

## Government 4th
What we said from the start of this debate was very simple, right? We don't need to know whether or not politicians have committed adultery in the past, or whether or not they are homosexual, or even this tiny detail of what could tell those politicians stayed in their family trips, right? All of those private informations that politicians do not disclose by themselves are the private information that must be protected on our side of the house.

With that in mind, I'm going to talk about two things. Firstly, on privacy. Secondly, on democracy.

Firstly, on privacy. The opposition side merely asserted that the people should be able to know without explaining to us why the right to know actually overrides the privacy that we have been talking about in this debate. We told you from the start of this debate, the very tangible harms that come with the intrusion of privacy by media organisations that are critical not only to politicians but also to politicians' families.

Now, there are reasons to believe that the individual's rights and the individual's rights to privacy actually override the right to know. For instance, I think it's clear that the media organisation always gets consent before using any videos in which a person is shot, for instance. You always get explicit consent from the person because those individuals are portrayed, right? This is analogous to what we are talking about in this debate. We think that individuals have the right to privacy, have the right to consent to what extent that information is actually available to the public, and that media absolutely must obey this principle.

The only response we got from the side of opposition was about the LGBT example. This is practically the only thing that they have revised. They say, but firstly, it's not enough to negate our point.

But secondly, they tell us that you get votes from LGBT at the point where you say that you're a homosexual individual, you found out that you're a homosexual individual, but then they also say that media won't make offensive comments on being homosexual. 

They completely miss the nuance from our argument, right? We said that this debate, even those individuals actively hide the fact that they're being homosexual means that they're presumably in conservative areas where they have high likelihood of being the subject of conversion therapy or being subject to arbitrary discrimination. Now, the harm is also that arbitrary discrimination, conversion therapy, but also imagine what happens when you are a dear Christian and the person that you have voted for in the last election turned out to be gay that you think is a sin. It's the point where those individuals absolutely go furious with those individuals. We think the amount of backlash those homosexual candidates get is enormous on their side of the house.

Moving on to the democracy point, they said two things. Firstly, about the corruption. This was merely an assertion, but secondly, we have rebutted from the start of this debate that this is an irrelevant thing in this debate and we got no responses.

Secondly, they asked about the right to know. This was again a mere assertion, but secondly, even if politicians are so morally egregious to the extent that they're really bad individuals, I think the fact that in the public sphere, they have not found out that they're morally egregious individuals already shows that in the public sphere, they can control their own behaviour, right?

What's important as a politician is not whether or not you're actually a good individual, but rather how you act in the public sphere, how you act when you meet the president of another country. Those are the important skills that politicians must have and the public must be able to assess. All of this information can be accumulated from individuals on our side of the house through interacting with those individuals face-to-face in the community centre if you're particularly interested in politics.

But let's take them at their best case scenario, which is that the right to know actually exists and right to know completely exists, right? Note that this is contingent on the assumption that the media on their side of the house will equally report private lives of every politician, thus people are fully informed of it. 

That's not possible because we told you in our second argument that presumably liberal media will focus on conservative politicians' private scandal for instance, so there will be a subjective control of information available to the public from the media organisation. So the harm is fairly symmetric even if we take their best case scenario. For all these reasons, please do not intrude the fundamental right that the politician has. Very proud to propose.
