# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #16 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

## Government 1st
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, three substantial points from the Prime Minister. Firstly, in the status quo, the privatization of the porn industry does harm to the sexual culture and the porn actress. And secondly, in this policy, it decreases the radicalization of the sex culture and saves many porn actresses. Thirdly, in the comparison, even if the privatization of the porn industry makes a diversified satisfaction of the particular target, the state doesn't prioritize these people. Also, we have to prioritize to save the porn culture.

So, before that, there are several models to our side of the house. Firstly, we ban all forms of the private porn industry, such as porn videos and porn websites and sex stories and so forth. And the discontent of the porn things by the state only makes it conscious of the not illegal things, not so immoral things, such as sex with the child or sex with the drug and so forth. These kinds of illegal or immoral things are never made by the state. That is the stance from our side of the house.

Moving on to my substantial. The privatization of the porn industry does harm to the sexual culture and the porn actress. In the status quo, due to the diversity of the privatization of the porn industry, many corporations want to make the profit. And they make many diversified videos, such as the rape video and the pedophilia video and these kinds of immoral videos and so forth. Why is that? The reason is very simple. Basically, the profit-seekers want to get the profit by the many numbers of people. Because if they just focus on the particular target, this profit is not maximized in the first place. That's the reason why the profit-seekers, in order to maximize the profit, they also make these very diversified videos. 

<POI> We are proud to restrict those kinds of rape and radical videos. And we are trying to push those entertainment as a porn industry. What do you think about that?

Firstly, it's impossible to completely supervise this porn industry. Because if the state also makes the right to make this porn industry, some porn industries also make these illegal things. If an illegal thing is banned in the aftermath, that data is at least spread in some terms. That's why the most important thing is that preemptively we don't make that kind of thing. That's the reason why that solution is only nationalized by the porn industry. Secondly, we are talking about why this privatization of this porn industry makes harm to the porn actors.

Now, this porn industry, there are many numbers of porn industry. Also, there are many people who want to be porn actors. That's why the value of the porn actors is decreasing now in the past. Because if some people criticize this corporation, our wage is very low. That time, corporations easily cut off these porn actors because there are a number of unacceptable people in the past. Now, these porn actors also have to work with a very hard environment. For example, there are very bad environments without their guardians. That's the reason why in the status quo, it's very harmful to these porn actors.

Secondly, why did this policy decrease the many radicalization of the sex culture and saving these many actors? Because now, the supervisor is the state. That's why the state never makes this violent content. Because if the state makes the violent content, this criticism is very large compared to this private industry. Because also, many of the citizens, many of the stakeholders, are always supervised by the state itself. That's why states also don't have the possibility to make violent content in the past. That's why compared to the status quo, we can only make moderate content of the porn industry. 

Secondly, also we can guarantee the value of the porn actors. Because also, the state is not a profit seeker, and also they have much money compared to the private industry. That's why also the state can't guarantee good environment for these porn actors. That's why if these porn actors become the disease, also the state can't guarantee to go to the hospital. Also, they can't save the future of the porn actors. That's the reason why compared to the status quo, this environment of the porn actors is very good in the first place. That's why this policy can decrease the radicalization of the sex culture to save the porn actors.

Finally, in the conclusion, even if the privatization of the porn industry makes the diversity and the satisfaction of the particular target, why the state doesn't privatize them? This is a valid judgment. We think that also the state also has to maximize the people's happiness and satisfaction. But in the status quo, some number of these porn videos also make the next harm to other people, or make the victim in the past. Because in the existence of the rape video, in the existence of the pedophilia video, some number of people see it, and after that, they mimic this video in the first place. And after the mimicking, they also upload this video to the porn website, for example, Poisonous or something, in the first place. 

That's why, ladies and gentlemen, as long as this content makes a new victim, and this victim can't stand up to the future, we don't privatize this value for these people. That's the reason why, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that, compared to the satisfaction of the variety of types of people, to protect the sex culture and protect the sex actors is very important. For those reasons, we are proud to support Poison.

## Opposition 1st
Porn industry is a thing which have like careful like action, have like careful preparation, in order to, like, in order to save like those kind of actors, or to make entertainment for every like citizens in today's society right. So, in today's debate, we have a certain question right, can like the state have like appropriate action for like having like porn industry right, can the state carry the burden, which is having in porn industry, and like create like happiness for every people.

We believe that the answer is no, the most appropriate character, we have to like pursue is to like talk about like those kind of company that have porn industry, how to oppose. For today's debate, like, let me have two arguments. One, why we can provide good environment for having porn industry like privatized. Two, what is going to happen in like our paradigm and in their paradigm having comparison.

So, like before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear definition and stance for today's debate. Um, so, like, in theirs of the house, they talked about that those radicalization is going to like given in porn industry, and it's going to make like these porn industry, like as a, like coercive situation, but we believe this is not true because in the status quo, we can see like lots of restriction that is given, like, such as like, if there's child like abuse, like child porn, like mostly, there's like such regulation that, like, restricts like child abuse. 

And moreover, about like those, um, like those, like those, like actress, like care, right? Like theirs of the house, we talked about, like, those company can't care, like to those actress, and there's like such diseases. But we believe in America, like there's lots of investigation that are taking in porn industry, right? Most of the time in America, they have like lots of preparation for those kind of actress. And for those actress, they have lots of,  care, for example, like having pill or having condoms for like those kind of people. And if there's such HIV that are happened,most of the time, those all porn industry, and those kind of company can be stopped, right? 

<POI> So who is uniquely the one who investigates and regulates the kind of videos that go out? 

We believe that, one, the regulation are given by the state. But two, the care is going to be like provided by the company. And the company is really proud to stop all industry when such problem is happening, right?

So moving on to my argument, one, why we can provide good environment for like those privatizing porn industry in the state of court, right? So we believe, um, firstly, let me make a clear analysis of what is porn industry. Two points, right? One, it's about producer, and two about like consumers, right? So, one, let me talk about like those producer, right? Um, like, let me have like, like rebuttal, like concluding in like my argument, right? 

So, in theirs of the house, they talked about that, um, those, um, they talked about like those radicalization will be given, and also like those porn actress will be in like, for example, like, low wage, or in like, coercive environment. But we believe privatization is the most best solution we have to take, right? Because those producer of like those company are the experts, right? They know about like those actress, right? They did like long time like investigation in like those porn, like, um, actress, right? Why? The reason is really simple, right? His experience is like really different, right? Porn industry was given from like several decades, right? Like many decades, and the company knows about those producer, or those actress, that like which, like, um, like which like method is good, or how we can like have like, like those care of like those actress, right? So, the most appropriate, like, um, appropriate actor for like caring like those kind of actress should be like those companies, right?

Moreover, they talked about that, um, radicalization will be given, right? Like, that will be like, connecting to my like, second point, right? Those consumers, right? We believe consumers' needs are the important part, right? We have to talk about and guarantee about like those kind of consumers, right? So, like, if we see like those porn industry, like most of the time, like it's entertainment, right? We have to make happiness in those kind of porn industry, right? It's like same as like, for example, like movies, for example, like animation, right? It's same category that is given in like those kind of things, and we believe consumers' needs are important part, right? So, like, maybe like radicalization will be given, and radicalization will be happening in like those kind of adult videos, or like those kind of things, but we believe those radicalization is just an entertainment, right? We are like keeping on for pushing like those entertainment for like those each individual, right?

So, moving on to my second point, what is going to happen by like, um, taking, right, like comparing the government side and opposition side, right? We believe government side is like now having a big failure, right? Having a failure, which they're talking about that, um, the country will, or the state will, like, keep having a good, like, environment for like those consumers and for like those actors, right? But we believe this is not true, right? The country is not like experts, right? They don't know about what is happening, or what is the consumer's feelings, or what is the actor's feelings, right? So, they can, like, appropriately, like, make porn interesting in today's society, so our side will provide, like, more, like, like, more, like, suitable way for consumers and for, like, producers, so these are reasons why we're positive.

## Government 2nd
LO claims the government fails to control this kind of porn industry when they themselves literally conceded that it was the government who regulates this industry as well. We simply do not understand why the single-handed most powerful authority of a nation, which is the state, cannot uphold the burden in comparison to a couple of small companies. I'm going to prove to you three things in my speech. First, I'm going to prove to you why, like, according to their, like, um, given the analysis they said, why our side can achieve that much better. Secondly, I'm going to be talking upon, like, their talk about entertainment and why that could be limited. And thirdly, I'm going to be talking to you why our side can uniquely protect the dignity of these actresses.

First, a couple of refutations. They said, uh, the LO came up here and said that, uh, that, like, these companies can provide care for actors. We say and we concede that this is true, but this is only true only on a surface level. We think that in cases of big companies, they might have the financial, like, opportunity to look after these actresses. But I, I would argue that these small companies are not equally capable of looking after these kind of actresses. We think in the majority of time in, um, in order to like seek the maximum profit, we think they're more likely to abuse. They're more likely to exploit and go to radical videos like rape, which can gather a lot of money by a lot of extremists. We think upon this, we think that our side, when you nationalize this industry, you're able to provide more care for actors because you ensure that there's going to be a sustainable environment. You ensure that there's not going to be no legal behavior and you allow these actresses always a system to opt out by going to court instead of engaging in potentially illegal behavior by small companies.

Second rebuttal is upon their point about producers. They said that, uh, these companies have a lot of like experts. First, we don't simply understand why our side can't have producers. We think that our side can unilaterally have a lot of producers and a lot of experts and a lot of health professionals that are hired by the state. We think that's not really important. 

But secondly is I think their side is gonna have the likelihood of having producers who like, who could actually like abuse these actresses based on like holding like access to some of the weaknesses and threatened to exploit their kind of weaknesses and to like lure them into like more extreme behavior. I think that kind of like extreme cases will decrease on our side because you're now going to have producers who are controlled and like made, like, monitored by the single hand, most powerful authority in the nation that therefore we say that our side can provide a safe, better, safer, and a better, more expert controlled kind of environment.

Given that I'm going to prove to you why entertainment can be limited to some extent. They said that, Hey, you need to care about consumer needs that this porn industry is very likely entertainment. We agree that the porn industry is entertainment, but we disagree upon like the point where we say that in the case where some videos cross the line of like legality, we think that that is extent where the government can intervene. We agree that entertainment is like guaranteed in the case of like soft sex of like just having any kind of sexual intercourse. But we think that there's a clear difference between allowing rape and bestiality and pedophilic videos and, and calling that entertainment. 

I think there's two problems. First is that we think that at the borderline where you cross what the like state like allows and organizes, we think that is the extent where it is not entertainment. I think that is like just breaking the law and using it to try to incite the behavior of potential criminals in the future. We think that these kind of videos legitimize these extreme views and we think that is not entertainment. We think that is a form that should be controlled by the government.

Given that, why does our side save the dignity of women actors? And I'm going to improve the story of why our side is going to just be better or make a better society overall. We think that the porn industry is different from other like industries like movies and theaters because we think that there's a unique difference because we think the sexual images and sexual depiction is, is able to cause and affect attitudes more perniciously. Why is it so? Because we think that the way we view other genders is constructed by the kinds of sexual imagery that is propagated in mass media. That's why in the case of porn, in the porn industry, we think that in order for, in order to generate profit, companies make titles like, hey, for instance, if it's a woman rape, this woman like rolling their eyes, any kind of extreme values that dehumanizes the expression of women.

We think the privatization, um, we think there's three effects the privatization companies does. First is that this constructs bad norms where women are being treated as a sexual object. We think that LO just said that, hey, we, we regulate this, but we think in the status quo, that's not really true. And we think companies don't have an incentive to control it, anything because that means that's going to mean less profit. 

Secondly, is it promotes particular body norms. So then you're going to have like really super attractive blonde, big boob girls. We think that those kinds of stakes are going to be reinforced for the sake of profit. We think that the audience can be like very attracted to those unrealistic behavior. And we think that's going to lead to very unhealthy images.

But thirdly, as I said earlier, there's no incentive for these private companies to shut out videos. Two reasons. First is because there's a lot of amateur videos, which are unregulated by these companies in the first place. Right. 

But secondly, is that there won't be any kind of profit once you take away these kind of rape or extreme videos. That's literally the reason why these kinds of regulations have failed in the past. 

We think that given these three effects, there's an, we think the privatization does like create a bad thing, which, um, dehumanizes the dignity of women. How do we combat this through nationalization? It's that we say that the porn industry is when you nationalize something, it is the manifestation of the government's thoughts. That's why we think when our side is able to nationalize and prevent any kind of, well, like amateur video to go out, we've confined the imagery to a very restricted and controlled. We think that the States can like enforce regulations and what's acceptable and what's not much better than a, what a small company can do. We think that when you control a certain pool and shut out everything else, there's going to be four, three effects. 

First, so you can, for instance, it's going to be easier to enforce the uses of condoms and contraception to women. Secondly, is that we can ban child, child, um, child rape scenes, uh, child porn scenes or like rape scenes in general, because I don't think that the government would want those kinds of images to go out. And thirdly, is that you're going to make sure and restrict having kids access to this private companies who really don't really care about kids watching it, because that just means it's going to be more profit given that I think the profit can be mitigated for the sake of protecting, um, these actual workers for this. We think the entertainment can be diminished and we want to combat the truth.

## Opposition 2nd
Nationalization leads to promotion of foreign industry for citizens. So, is promoting foreign industry for citizens a vote for the government? Our answer is no. Foreign industry is a part of entertainment for some people, but also harmful and should be careful for other people, for example, teenage people. So, there is no necessity in promoting all citizens. And, I move on to report to the government side.

There is an alternative to ban exceed industry porn industry like movies which contain sex with a child and exceed porn pictures. The government, we think that the government makes laws to ban illegal porn industry. For example, people under 18 or 20 age don't intervene in the porn industry and other sexual industries. And, also set punishment to the company, in case the company forces them to intervene in the porn industry. Then, we can regulate exceed porn industry without nationalizing the porn industry. So, we think that there is no necessity for nationalization.

And, which is better for us? Which is better for our society, to nationalize the porn industry or not? If privatization of the porn industry is a part of entertainment, these companies can expand in a country and achieve diversity. And, which is well-known about customers' favorite? We think that company porn industry is better known. So, for that reason, nationalization of the porn industry is not good for the porn industry and our citizens. Thank you.

## Opposition 3rd
When there's a porn that is nationalized or when there's some porn that is privatized, we believe if we see in those entertainment we believe we can have more entertainment action by privatizing because the privatizing given by those companies knows the most about consumers and they can attract those consumers the most and knows more than those countries. So we are proud to oppose.

Let me have two clash points between today's debate. One will respect the environment of those actresses and people to how entertainment should be in today's society. Before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear rebuttal for individual rebuttal for those previous speakers.

Their argument was like they said that first it's really difficult for it to completely ban and radicalization will be given in today's society. But we believe this is not true because, as we insisted in those POI and as we insisted in constructive arguments, we said that those regulations will make those radical scenes like ban and we believe those in this society like those scenes are now not given, right? 

Moreover, what the second speaker talked about was that norms will be given and those women's dignity will be taken in those societies. But this is not true because most of those radicalized, for example, those rape porn, it's mostly people know about it's entertainment, people know that it's just entertainment and not like real radicalization or real rape. We believe every people know about that, and we believe this is not a big issue we have to talk about in today's debate.

Moving on to my clash points, one which will respect these actresses. Government side talked about it will just have a really bad environment for those kinds of people and actress care will collapse. But we believe this is not true. Opposition side will clearly claim that the most quickly that can move is those private companies, right? The quickness is really different. Companies can really quickly move for moving for those actresses, and when those problems will be provided, they can have a solution, right? Moreover, the point we wanted to push is those actress care. Actress care is not about those HIV or those kinds of diseases. We believe mental care should be the most priority. In our side of the house, we can accomplish that.

So, the last point, the last clash, how entertainment should be. Government will restrict radical scenes, they'll restrict every scene, and the country will control that. But compared to opposition, we will restrict just minimum restriction. We will make a regulation. What we want to push is those entertainment, the company mostly knows about those consumers, right? We believe those porn industry should be shown as entertainment, and humans should be looking at those porn industry as entertainment and fun. For these reasons, we are proud to oppose.

## Government 3rd
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. The question of this debate, we clarify the question of this debate. Oppositional side said, A, they strongly regulate the content and B, they invest in the porn industry from the government. But if so, what is the exclusivity compared to the government bench? Because even without regulation, even without investigation, also the government can make this content in the first place. And if they strongly regulate, also they don't achieve their goal. Because they are very limited of the diversity in the first place. That's why their argumentation is false. The key, the opposition argument is said.

So, given that, what is the sole plus point in this debate? Firstly, which side is the larger possibility to decrease the abusement of the porn industry? And secondly, whether we need to satisfy the many consumers by this diversity content? 

So firstly, which side has the larger possibility to decrease the abusement? They said regulation is enough. But we told you three things. Firstly, the state can't always supervise each corporation. Because there are many members of the corporation and this content itself, making content itself is very black box. And the state can't supervise. 

And secondly, B, the diplomats already said, this borderline illegal content and immoral content is very, very vague. That's why it's very difficult to limit preemptively. Once it was made, the Prime Minister already told you that. This video is very easily spread. 

And it's also, this content dehumanized the female. And it's directly make the bad harm into the society. That's the reason why this preemptive measure is very important. That exclusivity is only remain from the government.

And secondly, so they said, entertainment is not always guaranteed by the private corporation. But we told you that this entertainment is not so important compared to the harm. That argument is, I'm saying from the second point. So whether we need to satisfy the many consumers. So they are afraid of the decline of the entertainment of the quality. Because they say, this corporation always hire this professional producer. But the Prime Minister already said that. Also, it's not a mutual exclusion. Because states also have, also hire this professional producer under the status of supervision. This only excluded is the risk of this bad content in the past years. That's why, as long as this professional producer exists inside. This is not so mutual exclusive. And it doesn't mean, it means this opposition's argument is not stand in the first place.

So secondly, we already did the comparison of the diversity of the entertainment and the safety of the society. Opposition side always prioritizes the diversity of the entertainment to satisfy the many numbers of the people. But we already told you that. This satisfaction is not important compared to the increasing of the victim. Because if once this video is spread, and many numbers of the violent action also possibly occur. For example, the mimic of the violent content such as the rape, and such a beast, and the upload of poltergeist. So that kind of the violent action is also comparatively occur to the opposition's bench. That's the reason why, if as long as the victim is not saved by the opposition's bench. We don't prioritize this diversity of the entertainment. For those reasons, we proudly propose the motion.
