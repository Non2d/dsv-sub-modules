# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #3 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

# Debate Transcripts
## Government 1st
Thank you very much, Speaker. As long as the prisoners are also a member of the society, it's a totally unjustifiable act by a government to deprive the rights of the board from the prisoner. That's why we are very happy to allow prisoners to vote. Two things to talk about.

First of all, I'm going to talk to you about the importance of guaranteeing the right to vote under the title of protection of fundamental human right, even for prisoners. Second of all, I'm going to talk to you about benefits for criminals and also the whole entire society as a whole. Clarification of a simple model. Of course, we are going to allow prisoners to vote if they are qualified to have the right to vote in the real society. For example, in Japan, they are allowed to vote over 18 years old and such kind of things. And we are very happy regardless of what kind of punishment are they and how long they are in the prisons. I don't totally care about that regulation. As long as they are a member of society, as long as they are in the prisons, we are very happy to give the right to vote for those people.

No, thank you. Moving on to the first point about the importance of protection of the fundamental human right for prisoners. I have two reasons here. First of all, in a very general topic, even prisoners, they already have fundamental human right to begin with. For example, they have, of course, the right to life. For example, they are available to have adequate food. They can have enough amount of sleep. And, of course, there is no worry of torture, right?

This should be allowed, and there is no prisons to intervene here. And more than that, we actually allow prisoners to have to some extent of the access to society. What does it mean? In terms of the cultural happiness, for example, they have access to know about society well by reading a book or by watching TV or by reading newspaper or something like this. And they, of course, can work in accordance with the real working environment to go back to society easier and to feel that kind of member of the society, right?

That's why we actually allow prisoners to pursue to some extent of the quality life as well as the right to life under the title of the fundamental human right to very much begin with, right? That's why second of all, the right to vote should be regarded as a fundamental human right. That's why we should recognize this should be given to prisoners as well.

So what do I mean? For example, even status quo, regardless who you are, such as gender, nationality, generation, income, the right to participate in politics, the right to reflect your opinion in politics is actually allowed to every single people, ladies and gentlemen, because we, of course, recognize the importance of the liberal democratic society to try to catch up every single opinion and to try to decide the priority of the process and the law, ladies and gentlemen, right?

That's why this should be done regardless of who you are, no matter how many, no matter how prisoners actually committed the crime in the past, right? That's why it is important to represent your opinion and they can finally feel as a member of the society, it should be allowed any point of mention before him.

<POI>Why should criminals like Nicholas Cruz, who shot up dozens of innocent children in Florida, be allowed to vote on gun control? 

First of all, don't just stick to the extreme opinion to very much begin with. Second of all, even for those people, we should allow them, we should allow the right to voice out your opinion as a member of society, which is same to, for example, the right to publish books to the public. I'm going to explain the analogy a little bit later.

OK, moving on to the second point about that's why we recognize this, the treatment, current treatment to prisoner is kind of the disenfranchisement of the fundamental human right for the prisoners, right? So, like I say in analogy example here.

So, for example, the right to voice out your opinion is already allowed. And of course, the right to somehow make change other people's opinion is also allowed in the status quo. For example, like, please remember, for example, some of the very bad guy like a serial killer published some of the statement from prison. And this is actually kind of supportive opinion for the criminal. Like, please remember, the Yama Yurien Uematsu Hikoku actually published the statement that kind of the people. There are some people, handicapped people should be terminated. Right. But it is actually allowed to state it and allowed to publicize to society. Right. But this is the point. It is allowed to voice out.

But it's totally a free choice of every single individual whether or not they're going to take it seriously. And of course, that kind of extreme opinion must be burned out in natural discourses. And it should be this kind of idea should not be taken.

Right. So moving on to the practical benefit for society and criminal. So why it is good for criminal. I have a good point in terms of rehabilitation, because they finally get the incentive to know about the actual society. Right. Because the political party can provide a benefit for them. That's why they have a very happy incentive to know about what kind of current news appears. And they can start reading a book about a political party or, you know, the current affairs and so on by watching TV as well. That's why they can finally understand the common sense of the society, rule, regulation. And in the future, they will be easier to adapt to society with enough adequate ability of the common sense.

Second of all, in terms of society, it is also good because the political party has a massive incentive to reflect the prisoner's opinion. Right. That's why they can try to identify what kind of benefit they like to get. And they like to solve the prison issues in prison. For example, the very, you know, the not good quality of the prison environment is happening at the moment. Political parties are very happy to fix by presenting a manifest and so on. For example, the financial issue is also the problem at cause and the trigger of the criminal that the political party are very happy to, you know, try to tackle against that.

## Opposition 1st
The crux of the government's case was that voting is a fundamental right that should be granted to everyone and to every single person in the world. PM also brought to you that there are going to be benefits to criminals, but also society as well, because there's going to be a way of trying to incentivize these criminals to not commit a crime anymore and that we think that political parties are able to find the middle ground of benefits.

I think that the biggest issue with the Prime Minister was that they neglected the fact that voting is not a fundamental right, but rather a privilege. Why is this true? Because we think that in the vast majority of instances, the voting comes with certain responsibilities and that responsibility is to uphold the law and make sure that you are able to look after what the government wants you to do.

Look, if PM and government side of the bench is trying to promote this idea of fundamental rights, they need to prove to you why we can still kick out and exclude minors and young children from voting. They also need to prove to you that if it's such a fundamental right that it's upholding our sense of dignity, they need to prove to you why we don't allow these young children to vote, or in the case of people like me who come from Korea but don't have a certain nationality. We think that if voting is a fundamental right, they need to be able to explain to you why these people cannot just vote.

Therefore, I'm going to examine one issue in rebuttal first. Given that they haven't absolutely failed in proving their burden upon why voting is a fundamental right, I'm going to talk to you about the pragmatic consequences they talked about. They said that criminals are able to publish books, so given their logic, we should allow prisoners to vote. So, realize that there's a fundamental difference between publishing a book and voting, right?

First, we kind of doubt the premise that you can publish a book during your criminal ages, but let's assume you can. Look, the difference of publishing a book is that in the case of publishing a book, you're reflecting the fact of why you had to commit a criminal, and it's showing a sense of guilt in committing a crime, right? This is different from voting, when prisoners try to legitimize their views and agree to more radical changes in the case of catering to politicians, right? I think there's a fundamental difference between publishing books, and we don't think that should be a metric for allowing prisoners to vote.

Now, given that, if they want to say that, then we say the fact that we are already removing certain rights in the case of prisoners because they broke state laws is self-indicative of the fact that this isn't a fundamental right and isn't beneficial to criminals.

I'm going to explain two arguments in my speech. First, why this is principally incorrect. Secondly, why it leads to worse social outcomes. Let's look at the principles first, two layers in this argument. First is as I explained earlier, and this will directly clash with the argument about like what is voting, we think voting is a privilege, and this privilege comes with certain responsibilities and the responsibility to obey the law.

The fact that you are a prisoner is the act of refusing to obey the law. That means that the state is justified in removing certain rights in order for them to make this kind of certain rehabilitation, right? I think that the fact that you became a prisoner and disregarded the law means that you shouldn't be able to be allowed to benefit from the democratic system that you yourself decided to reject. We think that's a fundamental principle upon which voting should be based on, and in the case of minors, we think that the reason why we don't allow them is that they can't uphold the responsibilities of being part of democratic system, but also that they can't make a rational judgment because they're still young and they haven't completed the proper system of education that the state mandated. That's why voting isn't the fundamental right like PM tried to bring to you. It is a privilege, and we think that the moment the prisoners broke this privilege on their own, they shouldn't be allowed to.

But secondly, let's look at moral outcomes. We think it is conflicting for prisoners to be allowed to vote on things that literally sent them to jail for. That's why I gave you the example of Nicholas Cruz, right? Because we don't think that school shooters or people who shot people with guns should be allowed to talk about gun control, that rapists shouldn't be able to vote on abortion.

But let's take government's best case. That is that these kind of examples are extremely, extremely rare, and that in the vast majority of cases, it's like economic crimes like stealing stuff. We think that still the fact that it is principally you are able to vote on the things that sent you to jail isn't something that should be principally correct. For instance, in the case of people stealing stuff, we don't think that there should be policies that allow less punishment for stealing other person's property, right? We don't think that's something morally correct.

Now we think the point of law is to tell people that there's a line you cannot cross, and that fact that you are going to allow prisoners to vote means that you're going to be legitimizing their views, because we think, because just in terms of breaking the law, but also allowing them to vote means that they're legitimizing their own views about school shootings and stealing stuff, because they want people to cater to their own needs. In the case of moral high ground, and judging by the victim's self-reflection upon the fact that they're going to have murderers of their daughters voting on gun control, or how to use knives, we think that we cite as the moral high ground.

But let's look at worse social outcomes next. Second argument. Will prisoners be able to vote for good? The comparative is that on their side, there's still going to be, these prisoners are still going to be undergoing rehabilitation. That is, the prisoners are more likely to have conflicting ideas about, for instance, their thoughts about drugs or violence and the things that sent them to prison on the first place.

That's why, presumably, it's still going to be dangerous for their prisoners, for them to be able to vote rationally, right? On our side, in the case that they're rehabilitated and they're able to go out of jail, we think that they're less likely to vote for dangerous things, because it means that the state justifies that they have been able to go through successful rehabilitation.

Secondly, though, we weed out prisoners who face life sentences and death penalty, because on our stance, we're just going to allow anyone who's not, who is able to recover and go out from rehabilitation to vote. That is, in the case of prisoners who face life sentences and death penalty, I think these people are the most people that are likely to be disattached to life. These people are going to vote for radical policies, such as no abortion or legalizing pedophile, because they don't have the responsibility to look after society, because they can't be able to go out in society in the first place.

But thirdly, let's look at the perspective of those who want to get votes. Two layers. We think that prisoners become easy prey, and this is going to be a block of free voters. 

That means, A, they're going to be bribed with shorter sentences for having to vote, because they're going to take private prisons where there's no authority of the government.

Or B, is that they're just going to cater to prisoners' needs, which is the fact of shorter sentences and less harsh punishments. I think this will rather incentivize these prisoners to feel it is okay to commit crimes, but they're still going to have this fundamental right. Therefore, I think it is unjust for governments to take this motion.

## Government 2nd
We believe that prisoners are the same human beings and have the same rights as other people. We have to respect prisoners' rights, and my first speaker clearly talked about why rights are included in the vote. So we're proud to propose. For today's debate, let me prove two things: why prisoners' opinions are precious for reflection in today's society and the comparison between the government and opposition rights.

Before I move on to my argument, let me have a clear rebuttal to what the previous speaker was talking about. The previous speaker continuously claimed that the exclusivity of kids and minor people is now given in the status quo, showing that the vote is not everyone's right and that there's a situation excluding rights. But the difference between voters like minor people such as kids and those prisoners is that kids are just under knowledge, right? They're not taught to have a rule of society; they don't know the structure of society. Compared to criminals, criminals have a certain knowledge and fulfill the knowledge to have the right to vote. For example, compulsory education is now finished for criminals in today's status quo.

Furthermore, they said that rationality is a certain criterion we have to take, and we can exclude in those kinds of situations. But, for example, if we have a certain issue of undereducated people, we have a certain question: Should we take those uneducated people just because they can't make rational judgments? The answer is no. We can't take away the right to vote for those kinds of things, and rational judgment is not the only reason to take away the right to vote.

<POI> Okay, so to clarify, you're saying that prisoners are rationally knowledgeable despite the fact that they might have committed crimes and broken the law, potentially taking someone else's right. 

So you're saying that those prisoners are just having a certain cruel thinking, and it should also be excluded. But this is not the debate we're talking about. We're not talking about those situations; we're talking about whether or not those rights are excluded or not, and this debate will be that our side is now including the right, and my first speaker is completely proving why the vote is included, right?

Furthermore, like what the previous speaker was talking about is that it will reduce punishment when prisoners' opinions are reflected. But this is not true; punishment is not the category that will be changing. The category we're trying to support is those criminals' reasoning why they committed the crime and changing the social structure in the status quo.

Moving on to my argument. One, why prisoners' opinions are precious for reflecting in today's society. Let me make a clear analysis of what prisoners are. Prisoners know best why they committed a crime and what the psychological thinking was behind it. So let me take several cases. For example, the cases of robbing. When prisoners commit robbery, the reason is mostly a social or financial problem. So as we see these cases, prisoners are having a problem that the social structure is not fulfilling their needs. To that extent, we can reflect prisoners' opinions that they have a lack of social welfare, and the government can notice what problems are occurring and can contribute to this society.

Other cases are also clear, for example, murder. When murder happens, prisoners can only know why they murdered, what the reason was, and what the issue was. Most of the time, stress is given. So as we take this motion, we can contribute to changing this society and reflecting opinions. The impact of this argument is that the government can't know even if prisoners' investigations and psychological investigations are given. The only one that can know about the consequences and circumstances of prisoners is the prisoners themselves. So it's a beneficial thing to take this debate.

Lastly, let me briefly compare between the government and opposition. The opposition keeps talking about the principle of the argument and why this is unjust for taking, but they didn't even talk about what is the certain impact of not taking, and they didn't really extend on that. Our side of the house is clearly talking that we can contribute those opinions to this society and make a world where prisoners and those citizens can live safely. This is the reason why we are opposing.

## Opposition 2nd
Firstly, if they were, we think that they won't break these kinds of laws of democracy because if they are knowledgeable people, we think that they're going to obey these kinds of laws. That's actually why we think that it is not the problem. It is not the thing they should talk about.

Secondly, they say that by voting, people, the citizens can know what kind of certain policy is going to be reflected. But firstly, we say that voting doesn't mean you can know why criminals committed a crime. It's just voting for a certain policy. We think that it is not going to be a fundamental solution for it. And if you want to know why they committed the crime, we think that we can ask them during these rehabilitation sessions. 

And secondly, we say that they can voice out, like publishing a book or other things, as they told, right? We think that because of this, if the people, the citizens who are not the prisoners, say that it is right, then they are going to vote for these prisoners. We think that it is going to be a fundamental solution. And we think that because they have these kinds of ways to do it, we think that this is not going to be a justifiable reason. They're going to be privileged to vote in these certain elections. That is actually why we're going to say it is unjust.

Moreover, we say that because these prisoners once harmed our society, we think that this kind of thing is going to be a retribution for these people. Why is it so? Because if you harm the society, you're going to be restricted to some kind of thing, right? As we told you, for example, you're going to be in prison for a certain time. You cannot go out easily from these prisons until you're going to have those rehabilitations. Why is it so? Because we say that rehabilitation should be the time you're going to see your crime, and you're going to say that I did something wrong. 

And this means that these people are going to move well in order not to be prisoners and not going to have those second-hand crimes, right? We think that these things are going to be a deterrent for these people to commit a new crime or death. That's actually why we're going to say this criminal system and justice system are moving well in the current society.

Alright, moving to our argument. Our argument is very simple. We're going to talk about these politicians' lenient policies that stigmatize these prisoners. What is so? Firstly, we'd like to talk about what politicians are. Politicians are people who are going to think about every people who can vote in these elections because these people want to be elected in these elections. Because if they're not going to be elected, they're going to lose their jobs and salary. And so actually, these people are going to think about every people who are going to vote. 

Secondly, we say that the system of democracy is giving one vote to each voter. That's actually why we're going to say that if these politicians can get more votes, this means that these politicians have more possibility that they're going to be elected. That's actually why these politicians are going to think about the individuals. 
Therefore, if there is some kind of new right, for example, in this case, if these prisoners are going to be given a new right to vote, this means that the politicians are going to try to make a policy for these prisoners. And actually, we think that most of these political parties are going to try to increase these rights. And we think that these things are going to happen.

One, they're going to say that these prisoners have the right, so we're going to reduce the criminal justice system. For example, you're going to abolish death penalty or prevent giving harsh punishment to rapists or other people. Or you're going to reduce these works in the prison or other things. And we think that this means that these deterrents are going to be reduced in these cases. 

What is the harm? We think that social harm is happening in this case because they're going to have fewer deterrents, less retribution, which means that these secondhand crime or other things are going to increase. And this means that something like crime cases or secondhand crime, juvenile crime, or some kind of specific of these kinds of crimes is going to increase. 

So what is the harm? We say that the stigmatization is going to happen to these prisoners, and it's going to harm these prisoners. What is so? We say that no policies move 100% well. There are some failures. And now, for example, if you're young, you're going to say, because you're young, you do some kind of radical thing or like that. And actually, the stigmatization will happen in these cases.What kind of harm is going to happen? We say that the negative campaign is going to harm more to these prisoners. What is so? Because if you're going to be in the opposition party and you're going to criticize your government.

We say that the scapegoat that you can use is the prisoners, right? Because the crime is going to increase. You say that, oh, because the government did some kind of these things. We say that there are going to be more and more crimes in the societies or like other things. And the media are going to say these things too. So actually this means that the students are going to be affected and radicalize these things. This is the same case of the Hispanic problem of America or like the refugee problem of EU or like other things. We say that alienized people are going to be affected and stigmatized in these cases. Moreover, because they have something wrong in the past, people have more possibility to be stigmatized. 

What is the harm? Firstly, we say that there are going to be fewer retributions and rehabilitation because more companies or like other people think that they don't want to accept these people. We say that there are going to be less rehabilitation. 

Secondly, we say that the division in society is going to happen. There are going to be more pressure to the societies by defamation or harassment. 

Thirdly, we say that people are going to vote for this opposition radical party. And this means that politicians are going to take away more rights of the prisoners because they are going to be radicalized. This is actually why we are going to say these harms will happen. Thank you.

## Opposition 3rd
The world we saw the government draw is a world like this. A world where the murderer of your son can be allowed to shout for gun control, where the rapist of your daughter can vote for abortion, or even someone who stole money from you, which was supposed to be used to treat your mom's cancer, is going to get away scot-free because, according to a member of government, it was a failure of the state. I think as opposition, it's pretty abhorrent to say that people who have broken the law, or potentially even taken lives, or taken someone else's property, and I think it is morally abhorrent to say these kinds of people are knowledgeable and rational, so we can provide them the right to vote, right?I think the moment they decided to not take the side and take the side of victims, we think that we win this debate.

I'm going to examine two issues in this speech, and I'm going to examine the failures of government.First, let's look at the principles, because I think it's pretty clear that they already dropped the point about voting, but I'm going to talk about it. I think the government failed in engaging any points about how prisoners shouldn't be allowed to vote, especially for the things that sent them to jail, right? We think it's pretty weird for them to put prisoners into jails and say, but you can still try to convince us to not do so. We think that's a pretty weak stance for the government to take.

The only response and engagement we heard throughout this whole debate was that, in the vast majority of instances, people are so poor so they can go to jail, so you can vote. Look, I think that this is extremely disrespectful for all the rational and hardworking people who don't cross the line of the inhumane act of taking someone else's stuff. 

And even if we take their best-case scenario that these prisoners, like these people who were coerced into committing crimes should vote, then we think they could vote after jail because that's the moment their citizenship is returned and that the state makes sure that they have been properly rehabilitated and they have been able to successfully reintegrate into society.

On a principle level, it is extremely bad and extremely abhorrent and extremely disrespectful for the government to say that prisoners are really capable actors. I don't know why they decided to side on the side of murderers, but I'm going to go with the stance the government brought to you. Given this, I think that voting is clearly a privilege, that all the people who have contributed to the well-being of society, in the terms of perhaps taxation, who don't make the inhumane judgment of breaking the law or taking someone else's life, those are the people that voting should only be granted to. On a principle level, this is already unjustified, so we say we win this debate.

But I'm going to examine this debate further and look at the pragmatics, right?Again, the government side was absolutely unable to engage in our point about how there's going to be bribery in private prisons because there's no regulation by the government. We told you the politicians are going to cater to the needs of these criminals, and the fact that they didn't engage any at all and hasn't refuted any of our points is a concession that society is going to be detrimental in the fact that there's going to be policies that cater to these pretty radical ideas of potentially no abortion, for instance. We think this is inhumane for the government to try to defend.

But let's take the best-case scenario, that was the whole rhetoric about how you need to find a middle ground, and we have to prioritize prisoners. Again, I'm not sure why they're siding with thieves and burglars and murderers and rapists, but let's say that you want to find a middle ground. We think that the way to find a middle ground is not for prisoners to vote on certain policies; it is to literally have a one-on-one talk with them during rehab sessions. So even under the best-best-best-case scenario, it's still possible on our side.

There was no engagement coming whatsoever from my second speaker talking about how there's going to be stigmatization, there's bad policies. Even if we take the best-case scenario where we prioritize prisoners' needs, we think that that side is achievable on our side. Don't side with murderers.

## Government 3rd
Speaker, have you ever heard such a double standard stance coming from the opposition? Although so many freedoms are actually allowed even in the opposition paradigm, under a third title of respecting the fundamental human right, such a right to voice out your opinion by publishing books, such a right to marry in the prisons, such a right to know about society by watching news, by reading a book, right? 

But why only the right to represent your political opinion should be terminated, should be infringed? I've never heard this exclusive reason from the opposition side. That's why under the title of respecting one of the important rights, we should in exactly the same way as other rights, we should allow prisoners to vote. Two conclusions here. First of all, whether or not prisoners are allowed in terms of a justification issue. Second of all, which can create a better society.

Moving on to the first samples about the justification issue. So I've heard probably some of the reasons why it is not justifiable to give the right to vote for prisoners. So in terms of rationality, right? So they say prisoners are not rational enough because they want to break the law. We should not give the right to vote or something like this. So here are some rebuttals.

Number one, prisoners actually, my great partner already told you, they already graduated compulsory education here. That's why they already know the fundamental rules of society. We should grant them as they are rational, right? We should recognize them as rational, right? So this is the unconditional right to voting system to very much begin with. That's why. 

And they say that, what about children? So the difference between children is that who don't really have the right to vote is that, so of course, children have not passed the compulsory education period yet, but those prisoners actually passed the compulsory education period. That's why they should be unconditionally know the fundamental rules. That's what we should recognize them as rational beings.

And even if somehow that those people are not rational enough because they are not educated well, that's governmental failure to educate people to implant an appropriate amount of common sense and regulation rule, this kind of academic structure to begin with, right? That's governmental failure to bear the burden. It's unjustifiable to push the entire burden on prisoners to deprive the right to vote to begin with.

And second of all, second rebuttal is that, so in terms of rationality, so it is the fact they want to break the law in the past, but it doesn't mean that they are not reflected that past action, right? They have potentially to fully reflect their past action and they have motivation. They have the ability to bring up reflected will to society, right? They at least should consider this kind of other scenario as well.

And last of all, so this is the most important argument. So even if somehow they're not rational and rational, this argument doesn't matter. Why is that so? Because it is justifiable, it is not justifiable to ask rationality for acquisition of voting right to begin with, right? 

Think about it. For example, in terms of economic policy, who is actually better people who can assess about the economics, future economics? Is it because it's probably the people who already graduated at university and who are educated well, right? But we unconditionally grant the right to vote for every single citizen regardless of the academic background and so forth. That's why the consequential result does not necessarily matter and rationality is not always, of course, matter to begin with, right? That's why fundamentally they should have the right to vote.
