Rating: Rather agree

Reasoning:

1. **Direct Refutation and Engagement**: Throughout the debate, both sides frequently addressed and directly refuted points made by their opponents. For example, the Government 2nd speaker directly refuted Opposition's argument about the feasibility of online communication by providing an anecdotal example about the difficulties elderly face with technology, arguing that online communication is not a sufficient substitute for physical presence.

2. **Specific Engagement with Opposing Claims**: The Opposition 2nd speaker engaged with the Government's argument about the need for emotional support by suggesting that emotional support can also be achieved through IT and SNS, directly challenging the idea that living together is necessary for emotional fulfillment.

3. **Responding to Rebuttals**: The Government 3rd speaker responded to Opposition's claims regarding the burden on children by illustrating how family members living together can manage their schedules and maintain independence while still being supportive—a direct engagement with Opposition’s argument about the implications of living together.

4. **Building on Previous Speeches**: The Opposition 3rd speaker engaged in building upon the argument that professional caregivers are superior due to their expertise, countering Government's stance that familial care is inherently better.

Overall, both teams showed a consistent pattern of responding to key opposing arguments across many issues. However, there were instances where specific details from prior speeches may not have been fully addressed, such as some nuances around the burden of caregiving on children, which leads to the "Rather agree" rating.

# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #8 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

# Debate Transcripts
## Government 1st
Speaker, the elderly of the current status quo are condemned to a life that is not lifed, where they await isolation and sadness without a sense of fulfillment until death. We support this motion.

Note two things before I begin my set of answers. First, is that this is not a policy debate. We think this is a comparison of benefits of harms to elderly and both children. But secondly, granted that opposition might attack the feasibility saying that this is impossible. We say that we characterize adult children as around 35 to 40, where they have extra income, where they have a stable life. We say this is going to be more than capable of having parents move in. We say this is going to be better for two reasons. Two substantive in my point. First is upon why this is good for elderly. And secondly, why this is good for children.

Let's talk about a first argument. Why is this good for elderly? But before I talk about that, let's characterize what the elderly really need. What they don't need is material consideration because they already have pension fees. They already have money built up from a young age. What they actually need is fulfillment, a care and emergency responses, especially in the age where you are likely to have more health issues or more mental issues. We think that when they live where their husband or wife might have passed away, they might have Alzheimer's. They're isolated away. We think what these elderly require the most in terms of practical is a sense of fulfillment. And we say our side is able to better prove that.

Before explaining why a world is better, two likely cases upon opposition. That is first is that under their side, they're likely to send elderly to retirement homes. The reason why this doesn't provide a sense of fulfillment is because these retirement homes are usually consisted of workers who only care about getting money. That means that if they're fed up, they're only going to give you the bare minimum. They're not going to care how their day was. But even if that these workers were able to provide the sense of fulfillment, we say that they're less likely and less susceptible to treat any kind of mental or health issues of these parents, just because the ratio of these workers to the number of elderly, especially in this world of aging population and a lack of nursery homes are proven. That's why we say that in the retirement homes, this is going to be impossible. 

But secondly, we say that in the case, the best case scenario that we assume that the child can assume and invest and get these elderly their own house. The reason why this won't work is because these elderly still won't get enough care. That is the parents don't want to bother children with their issues. They don't want to care because they already feel bad about getting their own house. They're going to love you and assume you're busy. That's why if you have back pain, you won't tell your children. And at this point, we say that issues are more likely to become too late to respond to. We think there's going to be a little world in turn, possibly even death, whether injuries or any kind of damage is untreated.

With this in mind, why is our world better? Three reasons. First is because when you live together, you're going to be more comfortable sharing your issues. You're more likely to talk to these elderly about their days or problems when you live together and see communication over the dinner table, for instance. 

But secondly, even if there wasn't any kind of direct sense of communication, we see that you're physically able to see their kind of issues since you're up close to them. So at the point when you see that they're limping or any kind of coughing extravagantly, we say that you can send them to hospital and make sure that they're going to be okay at a more urgent pace than opposition side. We say that you're able to provide more affection and love on our side. 

But thirdly, we say our side is better because distance creates apathy. You see them less, they become a secondary consideration that when you go there, it's just going to be a two-hour visit, which it was kind of an obligation, right? So in our side, you make sure that the relationships between the elderly and the child become primary considerations. They care about each other the most.

Why do we get better fulfillment? It's two reasons. First is because we say that we provide a sense of fulfillment because the elderly can watch their grandchild raise up or watch their own child be independent and go on with their lives. We say this is going to be much better. But secondly, is that the problem of the status quo in retirement homes is all the old people do is they just watch TV all day or just play bingo with their elderly friends. This is problematic because this is usually the reason why they don't have any kind of sense of living. This is one of the reasons why many people say elderly are more likely to feel depressed because they don't do anything productive. On our side, we look for things for elderly to do, such as interacting with grandchildren on a daily basis, perhaps cooking or doing any kind of more chores to help out the family. We say that in terms of fulfillment, our side is better. So to weigh this is that elderly people want fulfillment. We provide them, unlike opposition, where because of our likely cases that are analyzed, this is impossible for opposition's case. 

Secondly, why is this going to be better for children? Two reasons. First is that we open up important opportunities for women or single parents who are unable to afford nannies or cannot afford babysitters. That means that they're not able to take the jobs they want to take. They have to quit jobs they want to participate because they have to take care of their child and stay at home. At this side, we say that it's much better because women are able to seek help from parents. The parents are staying home. And instead of perhaps like affording some kind of stranger or some kind of shady babysitter, you're able to ask your parents for help to look after your grandchild. We think this is going to be better for both elderly because they could look after their grandchild. You're going to provide seek and affection, but also good for the child themselves because they can have their own child looked after.

But secondly, is that they won't feel a sense of regret. Is that we think that in the status quo, these children usually feel regret, not feeling depressed because they weren't able to do what they could have done when their parents might have had an injury at a retirement home when they couldn't find out their injuries during the two-hour visit of an obligation. We think these can often be the stamp for suicide or differentiation. For instance, we take care of mental health and prevent any kind of regret happening.

Now, we understand opposition is going to probably come up here with like some kind of likely case that these parents are going to impose social norms. So this isn't going to be true. It's not going to be good. Given that they say this, three rebuattals. First, is that parents who are extreme traditionalists will usually do this on both sides and do this from a young age. So this point wouldn't be really mutually exclusive. 

But secondly, is that this isn't susceptible because since they're parents now, we think they will have decent footing with one other. It's unlikely that the elderly would just be super mean and angry and dominant over an adult child. 

But thirdly, we think it's better to resolve these conflicting implications by living together. So if a child is gay, it's better to show that they're gay by living a comfortable life with them instead of just saying that the gay child is fine during a two-hour visit. At this point, we say our side is better for a world where both sides seek benefits. I'm happy to propose.

## Opposition 1st
Opposition side thinks that supporting their parents should be the proper aid. So today, we strongly oppose this motion.

So first, let me explain the model. And second, I want to explain why we are leaving. Second, I will explain the rebuttal. And third, I want to explain why leaving the superlative is good for the self-actualization for the children. And finally, I want to explain why it's also good for the parents.

So first, let me explain our model. So in the opposition side, of course, think that taking care of the parents is a very good thing. So we agree at this point. However, we think that taking care of the parents is, of course, good for the parents. However, it should also be good for the children. So we strongly oppose. So in our role, even if the children cannot live with the parents, we can support their parents. It is because they can support by the financial. So in the current situation, sometimes the parents cannot have enough money, only the pension. So our side, the children can help by the financial. So for example, if the parents want to hire a helper, the children can pay money instead of their parents. And secondly, even if they leave the superlative, of course, they can meet once a month. No, thank you. So they can also meet even if they are on our side.

So second, let me attack their point. They said that they could talk and live together. It is not always true because children can't talk if parents have dementia. This puts stress on the children and burdens them. And we will explain this point by my second speaker.

So let me move on to why living separately is good for self-actualization for the children. So we have the three ways.

So first point. First is that if the government side, they have the restriction of the time because the children want to care and children want to care their parents. So that means that they have to fix their parents' lifestyle. So that means that the children cannot enough their working or their hobby. Because, for example, maybe their children's wake-up time and their parents' wake-up time is different. And of course, the children worry about their parents can't meet only themselves. So they worry about it. So that means that they have to fix their parents' lifestyle.

And second point is emotional cost. So the care to care to their parents is a very hard work. So sometimes they cannot communicate not easily. So that's connected to the mental stress. And so this is a very bad thing. 

And so and on the contrary, why we can guarantee freedom for children. So then, however, in opposition, we don't have any restriction of the time because we live in the separate. So they can continue to work and they can continue the things that they want to do. And of course, the emotional cost is reduced. So that means that they can live freely in the government side. And as I said, the two, the opposition side thinks that locally is very important. So that point. Sorry. So it is better than the government side.

And there also this our opposition side is the good for the parents because we think the parents can be independent, and children can keep supporting. So the first day in a pleasant situation, parents is not in a future. So they become in the old that children supported them. So that means that they give up to become in the older and order to be low their functions. So children don't do it for it.

However, in our position side, parents will require only financial order remotely support. So that means that they have to do. They have to do a lot of work or a lot of things, even if they become in the old so that they don't give up. So that's really true. Their function is still OK. So it is also good.

And in addition, maybe there are children is a very worldly about their parents. So that means that sometimes is that parents is to extremely depend on their children. However, I think that, as I said, to training their function is a very important. So the hours, our arguments want to say that in the opposition side can can parents more and more independent. So it is also good for the parents. So we propose we oppose this motion.

## Government 2nd
The elderly that we are talking about do not need money. They do not need financial aid because they already have financial aid from other things like pension and so on. What we think is the most important for these elderly parents to live a fulfilling life is to have like emotional fulfillment, to be comfortable in their own homes, and be able to do things that they enjoy even in their later lives. We think that this sort of emotional support is more important than anything that the opposition can provide, which is only financial support. We think that the children are the only actors that can provide this sort of support for the parents. That is why we are very proud to propose this motion. 

So, three things in my speech. First, about which is better for the children. Second, about whether the elderly need the support from children. Third, about how relationships are bettered under our world. My refutations are incorporated into my points.

First, about children. Opposition gave us mainly two points. They told us that they'll have to adapt to their parents' lifestyles and that's going to be a burden for the children. Two responses. First of all, this isn't true because they told us about how these children will have to wake up at the same time as their parents and so on. We think that's untrue. You can just wake up at separate times. You can create a timetable to figure out how to fit your schedules together and so on. 

Second, they talked about how having parents who have dementia and so on is going to be a huge burden. We think that in the case of elderly who have extreme illnesses and so on, they will obviously have doctors to look over their health or their mental health and so on. We don't think that that burden is going to be completely on the children. Most of their health problems will be solved by, for example, obviously they'll have doctors visiting their house or they'll go to daily checkups and so on. We think that that sort of burden of checking on their health is not necessarily all on the children. We say that that sort of burden is not going to be huge in the first place.

Second of all, they told us about the emotional burden that these children face, that they're going to be worrying about their parents. We think that that's going to happen on either side. These children are going to be worried about their parents. On opposition, we say that rather that's worse because their parents are going to be far away from them, like in a completely different prefecture, for example, in an extreme rural area where there's no one around them. They're going to be extremely worried about their parents' health. They're going to be worried about how their parents are letting up in that situation. We think that that burden is much worse. It's much better under our side when they can actually check up on these parents daily. We think that that worry is going to be less under our side. 

We think that even if there's going to be an extreme emotional burden, we think that in the long run, as our first speaker told you, there's going to be less emotional burden on these children. Because these children in the long run will be unlikely to, for example, regret not helping their parents. We think that these children are indebted to their parents because their parents raised them. But if they leave them to, for example, if they leave them in a retirement home or live extremely far away from them, and they become emotionally or physically isolated, and they die as a result and so on, they're going to have this regret for the rest of their lives. We think that that is an emotional burden that they have under their side as well. In the long run, they're going to be less burdened under our side. 

Furthermore, we think that it's much better for children under our side, because if you live close to them, you're more likely to be able to help them if your parents need help. We think that the sort of worry or emotional burden is actually much worse under the opposition.

But second of all, let's talk about the elderly, right? Do the elderly actually need the physical proximity to their children? So basically, what opposition told us is that all of the support that the elderly need can be done financially, right? But we don't think this is true. And we told you this from our very first speaker, right? Financial aid is not what the elderly people need or what they want. We think that what they need is emotional fulfillment. 

And we think that the only actor that can provide that are the children. Because we told you from on the physical level, how it's much easier to, for example, talk about a health issue that you have, or something that you're struggling with as a parent to someone that you're comfortable talking to, which is someone that you've lived with all your life, which is someone who you actually trust, right? Whereas if you're talking to like, if you're talking to someone from someone from like a retirement home, it's much harder for you to speak up about these issues. And we also told you about how there's going to be emotional fulfillment, right? If you're left in a retirement home, you're going to be like spending every day just watching other old people play bingo. Whereas in, under our side, these elderly can actually see their parents, their children or their grandchildren grow up, and so on. And we say that the sort of emotional fulfillment is what these people need. 

<POI>As we are exactly enjoying right now, the attachment can be gained not offline, but also online by zoom video chatting or Skype video chatting. Why this alternative is not good enough.

About how these, these elderly parents need the physical help in like, within like health issues, first of all, but second of all, we also think that like, this physical proximity is important, right? Because if, if, like, we think that it's like, extremely unlikely that these children, we think that if you live extremely far apart, people are less like, these children are less likely to like check up on their parents, like over zoom or over like, over text and so on. Because first of all, the elderly are can't use the electronics as well as the children. But second of all, we think that these children will have to go out of their way to do so. And we think that this sort of physical proximity is important. 

And going on to how relationships are better under our world, we think that under oppositions world, if people if these children and the parents live separately, if they have disagreements, there's a physical barrier, and it's likely that they will stop seeing, seeing each other if they have a disagreement, and so on. But rather under government side, we think that these disagreements can be resolved in that moment, and people will be more likely to be able to resolve them, because they have that physical proximity, because they have to do that, because they live inside the same household. 

We think that generational differences can also be like bridged under our side, because these the elderly will like will be less isolated will be less isolated in like an extremely rural environment. And they'll be able to like, understand these generational differences, understand maybe learn how to use electronics, or like learn these societal norms that have changed, and so on. And we think that overall, this relationship between like these intergenerational communication is bettered, and the relationship of the children and the parents are bettered overall under our side, very proud to propose.

## Opposition 2nd
We can support for the elderly. Even if children can't live together, because children can use things like IT or SNS or money support, we can do it. So I will oppose this motion.

First of all, I will debate the argument. Second, I will explain about harm, like living with children's harm and living together with parents. And the second is changing the society to support the parents.

So first of all, I will rebut the argument. So they said that as South speakers touched on the point, they said like emotional support, they can do emotional support. However, it is no uniqueness because we can use IT and SNS. We can do video calling and we can do even if they can't, they can live together.

And so I will explain about children's harm to live together with parents. As the first speaker told you like time management and children will be tired, and it is a very serious point. So I will support this argument. So the younger have to take care of their parents, like their age is like 20s or 30s and so on. But, however, if we know or prefer this world, the children can work more and more. They can live free pressure. However, if we prefer this world, children have to, if the parents' support is very become burden, the children have to quit their work because it is very serious physical or mental burden. So why is it very serious? Because if the children feel very burden, they will, if they feel burden, they can't contact the outside because it is the family's problem. So it will lead to suicide. So it is a very serious point. 

And on the other hand, our argument is very superior because helpers or helpers facility is very good because they are very specialist and they can have a long term experience and they can be best case support. For example, male's nutrition or they can do exercise with the elder. So it is very good because the elder's body can retain good and their lifestyle can be retained mainly because the professional can support it. And their benefit is like physical safety for the elderly. However, it is not always true because elderly sometimes suffer because of care and neglect and even sometimes is bullying. So it is very serious for elderly and it is very serious for children and the parents because they will be tired more and more.

So, and the second is like a society's change. So why it is very, why this motion is happen? Because it is a family's norm. So it is very problem, like family's norm, because this tendency is very serious for society. Because first is we can't spend money for social security, security. For example, for example, a housing home and so on. And governments can't, can't, don't have to need to, need to support money because, because governments retain the children. So it is a very burden for children.

However, if we support them to live separately, so burden, we can solve the burden problem and children can support, support and society will, can support to live, to live the elderly. So, so if, if the children are married, get married, they can't, they will be harder to live their just life. So as my reason, I will oppose this motion. Thank you.

## Government 3rd
When our family moved to Chile, we gave our grandma an iPad so she can have FaceTime with us while we're living abroad. But my grandma managed to set an unknown password on her iPad, and she locked herself out. So then now we have an iPad in her house that hasn't been open for five years or more because she chose this like unknown password, and that she can't figure out. So basically, my point here is that just saying that we can do stuff online sounds simple, but it's not simple for the elderly, right? Elderly people are simply, no offense, but they're not really used to electronics. It's really hard for them to suddenly have this kind of device that allows them to communicate with people online. There's a lot of difficulties that face them from making a simple account or even getting the internet, especially in rural areas where elderly live in secluded areas away from the city. They don't even bother to have an internet or a Wi-Fi router, right? So I think it's very infeasible when they say that, oh, we can just do this online, right? But more importantly, we say that even if they do get this kind of communication via screen, it's still not enough, right? Like, of course, I enjoy debating online, but I rather prefer doing it in person. The same goes for taking care of people, right? We think that the elderly don't just need to see their child's faces, right? 

There are lots of other needs that they have that can only be fulfilled by them living together. So basically, we see that the elderly are, first of all, very lonely, because maybe their spouses died decades ago, or maybe they're living in really rural areas that have a decreasing population. They just need someone to constantly be by their side. 

But more importantly, a lot of elderly have diseases, like both physically and mentally, that prevent them from living healthily on their own. This can be like Alzheimer's, right? If you have Alzheimer's, there's always a danger that you can wander away from your house, not be able to come back, or you can't remember what you wanted to buy for your groceries, or these kinds of things are like daily disturbances in order for you to live a comfortable life. But more importantly, if you become physically weak in the process, it's really hard for you to even go to the supermarket, especially if you have to drive, for example, because you're in rural areas, or like it's really hard to walk around the house as well. Because maybe if you have stairs, or maybe if you have like a really long hallway, it's really hard for you without the support of someone beside you. So firstly, we see that these kind of physical and mental issues are significantly serious, and that can never be solved on opposition side where they only have the internet.

But secondly, why can't it be like helpers, right? Opposition so far has been talking about things like financial aid or getting helpers, or just sending them to daycare whatsoever. But we still think this is very bad for the elderly. First of all, there is not enough daycare nor helpers, especially in a lot of developed countries like Japan. There's so many populations of the elderly, and so few working-class people that the simple ratio isn't enough to fulfill the demand for these kinds of taking care of the elderly. So I don't think not all elderly would be able to get a helper or be able to get into a quality daycare. 

But more importantly, a lot of elderly don't want to go to daycare in the first place, especially if they have to leave the neighborhood or the community or the house that they've been living for decades and decades. It's really stressful for them to leave stuff behind, right? And more importantly, a lot of elderly, once they do go into daycare, they're going to be spending their whole day watching TV, playing bingo, doing meaningless stuff. And with this poor facility and little entertainment and small community, that overall leads to their stress, which also leads to the shortening of their lives, and a lack of quality of life that we can never support. That is why we still say that this kind of financial support provided to the elderly is still not enough.

Then on the other hand, what we see uniquely from the government side is things like physical health and physical comfort, and direct communication between the child and the parent. This kind of intimacy and this kind of physical proximity is what we can uniquely achieve on government side, and the reason why you should vote for the government.

But then let's look at what they themselves talk about in their arguments, right? So firstly, this whole issue about children getting a lot of stress because they have to cope with their grandparents or their parents' lives and so on. But we negate the very premise that they wouldn't be able to coexist, right? Let's say like a working mother, and like their high school daughter have really different lifestyles, and have maybe different times to wake up, but they still live together, right? We think that just because you wake up at different times doesn't mean that you're incapable to live together. I think it's very possible for these two members to live happily in the house. 

But even if maybe they might say, oh, if they're together all the time, it might lead to a huge burden, etc. You don't have to always be together, right? The unique thing about side government is that you're always in close distance so that you can check on them when you have to or like when you need to, but that doesn't mean that you're always going to be standing over them and watching their every move, right? You could always have different rooms, for example, or you have like a lot of like in the first floor, there's the first generation, and the second floor, there's the grandparents that can also, there can be lots of flexible lifestyles within that one house, where like people can live both independently, but where people can also reach out when they actually do need help. So overall, we think that like the possibility of this a huge emotional cost or like huge disturbance to their lifestyle is pretty low. Also considering the fact that today we have a lot of things like paid leave, or like companies supporting their workers to leave their job in order to support their parents, I think it's very feasible for the child to live healthily, even when they have to take care of parents.

But secondly, they talk about how like elderly becomes like overly dependent on the child, and therefore like it becomes like easy for them to give up, etc, right? Two responses. Firstly, like, just because they're dependent doesn't mean that it's something bad, right? We think that it's the elderly deserve to get a bit more attention than they do now, considering the fact that they have a lot of mental and physical needs that they can't cope by their own. So I think it's okay for them to depend on their child for groceries or depend on their child for things like mental communication or like daily chats.

And we think that like the will to live and the will to survive and keep fighting wouldn't decrease onside government because you're always together with your family, your son or your daughter or your grandchildren. Being with your family together is your motivation to keep living, right? On the comparative, when we see old people dying off because they're so lonely in offside opposition's world, we think that there's a higher possibility that elderly becomes more motivated to keep living, and they wouldn't give up inside government's world.

So secondly, our second response is that like, in the end, it's comparatively better than what we see outside opposition, where like a lot of elderly people do not get the resources they need, do not get the mental support, the attention they need, and they ultimately die off, either from like mental, like lack of mental support, or lack of physical support. So overall, what we see onside government is both the elderly and children living together in harmony, supporting each other, and leading happier and sustainable lives for all these reasons.

## Opposition 3rd
Their characterization of elderly people is, to some extent, too much thought. The reason why I know this is because I have a teacher's license for junior high school and high school, and I visited a real nursery center, and I know the real situation of how elderly people look like. As exactly, they characterize some people with Alzheimer's. Those who have Alzheimer's really need immediate dependence right now, immediately. For those people, I don't think it's appropriate and realistic characterization that those with Alzheimer's or those kind of elderly people are capable of taking care of their grandchildren. It is very unrealistic. Rather, we think those with Alzheimer's or elderly people are often times, sometimes not, sometimes very getting angry or shouting around at midnight and they start walking around at midnight, and they have to find it. That excessive burden is too much. 

And we think there is no justification suggested by the government side why this kind of excessive care must be necessary except for sending them to the center or helper and why it should be done by children. This kind of justification is still not heard at the last of the debate except for the material benefit of the spiritual or psychological happiness for parents, and I don't think that's not a good enough reason.

Two crush points I found, first of all, which is better for children, last, which is better for elderly people. Very simple. 

Moving on, first of all, which is better for children. So we are saying is that in order to self-actualize for their children fully in terms of the flee from any specialization to choose whatever job they want, whatever partner they want to stay with, whatever hobby they like to do or the place they live, whatever. This kind of situation to live with parent is very narrowing down their entire choice. 

And they somehow rebuttaled to something. Number one, in terms of the benefit for their children as well, like I say, they can sometimes take care of their son, granddaughter or please kick out this kind of very independent elderly characterization should be kicked out of this debate. Rather, those elderly people are psychologically weak or those really need health care immediately. That's why they are not capable of doing that.

And also, in order to take care of those grandchildren, still we think relying on third-party systems such as babysitter, nursery center is much superior in comparison because they have child care knowledge based on theory, for example, the appropriate amount of food, education or emergency medicine, etc. On the other hand, those elderly people don't follow that theory. That's why we think at least when it comes to taking the criteria of child-caring, still a third-party system is superior rather than relying on these elderly people.

And also, that I confirmed at the rebuttal, is that sense of regret is happening. That's why in order to prevent that, they have to stay with parents. I don't think so. Because first of all, even right now, I sometimes visit their grandparents' house, a parent's house, on a quarterly basis in a year. And for example, I'm going to visit them in Golden Week and sometimes Obon and before the end of the year. And that's, I think, very good enough to see them, how they are doing. And that is very good enough. 

And also, sense of regret is anyway happening on both sides of the house. Because sense of regret is coming from the fact that people have already passed away, right? Just because you guys are staying together does not necessarily mean the sense of regret to death is suddenly disappearing. I don't think, in terms of the amount of the sense of regret, there is not much difference confirmed still.

On the other hand, let me flip the entire argument of the sense of the emotional points. We are saying, Mika-san greatly explained, rather in terms of the sense of psychology, that staying together is worse off. Why is that? Because, like I said, as an introduction, taking care of those parents is a very much burden, right? So they are sometimes shouting around at midnight. They sometimes walk around the street at midnight, they have to find it. It's too much. That's why sometimes it's called カイゴ疲れ, right? You know that. Sometimes it's called depression, sometimes it's called even suicide, or there are terrible consequences happening. That's why, in terms of the benefit of the sense of regret, it's much uncertain and rather we think the psychological cost is going to take too much. That's why don't rely on the affirmative argument. 

That's why, in terms of self-actualization for children, this point clearly stands. They can choose whatever job, they can stay with a partner, family relationship, whatever the form they like. They don't have to change the place to live; they don't need to go to the suburb area suddenly. That's why, in terms of self-actualization, I also took the debate.

Looking at two criteria. First of all, their safety. Second of all, their psychological aspect. 

First of all, safety. So, we have already suggested the superiority to this debate, right? In terms of safety, in terms of medication or scientific approach, relying on the center or helper is much superior to those children, because they have enough knowledge or they have enough, you know, they are already professioned based on the nutritious food, based on the what amount of exercise is appropriate to give, and human interaction and so forth. 

They suggested that, first of all, there is no center available. Okay, by relying on the norm, children better to stay with parent. Because of relying on this norm, unfortunately center is in shortage. Rather, we live on our side that children should stay away from parents by relieving our pardon. Rather, we can have the consensus to send the money to the child care center and the elderly care center and the helper. That's why, in order to the amount of the center, this problem is already solved. 

And also, emotion, right? So, I understand to some extent, granted, right? But still, like I say, the kaigotsukare issue, because of depression, suicide, because of that, sometimes they even neglect to take care of them. Sometimes they start bullying their parents. In order to prevent, rather we think, an appropriate amount of separation is necessary for those reasons, rather than all.

## Opposition 4th
Now, adult children are limited, and they are just before overwhelmed. So we need to give them more freedom and for also parents becoming more independent. So we are happy to oppose.

First of all, their government side. It is no necessity for all because first about the communication, like why only they need to communicate with, why the family is the most important. Because this just increases the possibility to not communicate with others because the parents only just depend on the adult children and the people around them. So if we make them more independent and communicate with more other people, this is more good for their communication. So it is no necessity.

And about the grandchildren, if the adult children take care of their parents, like those adult children can't even have time to care for their children. 

And also about third, about the emotional support. Like, is it necessary to live together? Because like, they were saying that it's like they can't use this electronic thing and so on. But however, like they can still use their cell phones. But we can't talk to them and we can't know their conditions and so on. So and also, as my other speaker said, like they may neglect those things, bullying and those things, it is really emotional support. So to prevent the situation, it is no necessity.

And about their health problems. They were really talking about like they can't go to the helper and those things. But however, as our second speaker said, like we can change the norm. So if we change the social norm, like those government will try to support more helpers and those things. So we can also solve these communication problems, too.

However, our point, we have high necessity because first, the adult children have no freedom. And they were saying that like they can, they're living together. So like they can do timetables and so on. But however, they first of all, they live together. So the adult children have to make up time. It is certain. So but time is very important for everyone. Right. So it is it's not good to intervene in their time. 

And also, again, about the emotional cost. If it's the if their parents have a serious disease, they will definitely become tired to support. So it is more good to use a professional helper because they know really about it. So it's not tired. So it is very necessary.

And they were like talking. They were saying that it is peace. But support is not peace. Right. Because if they are like happy. They don't. Those suicides together don't happen and they don't like those depressions don't happen. But because their target is like people. Their parents can't even go to the supermarket, even move. And it means that they are in heavy condition. Right. So we have to give big support to them. So it's so easy for those things.

And adult children will certainly worry a lot and always think about parents so they can't concentrate on their working and so on. And that's why it's better to rely on helpers. At least mental burden will become less. So people need time. So everyone, every people have rights to live more freely. So we are happy to oppose. Thank you.

## Government 4th
Start with the elderly. Many of the elderly in the status quo die from loneliness; they're unable to go to supermarkets because the supermarkets are like 50 miles away in extreme rural areas. So many of the elderly suffer from this kind of emotional and physical burden of being away from their family, being away from people they're comfortable with. We think that this sort of physical and emotional support is something that can only come from living in close proximity with their family, and we see that that sort of support is what the elderly need the most. So we think that this debate mainly came down to the question of which has more benefits for the elderly and the children. 

So two clash points first, which is better for the elderly, and second, which is better for the children.

First, on the elderly, we think that opposition overall gave us not much of an explanation of how their side is comparatively better than our side in terms of giving a better life for the elderly. They told us a couple of alternatives about how we can also provide these benefits under their side. Mainly, they told us two things. 

First, they told us that financial aid is enough, but as we told you from the very first speaker, financial aid isn't what the elderly need. We say that what the elderly need is physical help like going to the supermarket to get groceries that they need or being able to walk around the house, being able to talk to someone about their health issues and so on. 

Second, they told us about hiring helpers and so on, right, but we told you, we told you that like daycare and like those helpers are lacking, especially within an aging population, like in Japan. But we also said that there are unique benefits that come from the children and the family of the family members of the elderly helping them because they're more comfortable in that situation. They're more comfortable talking about their health issues, and also, they're able to physically help within their own household, like help them around the house, help them get down the stairs, and so on.

Third of all, they talked about how an online environment is possible and so on, but we've told you that these elderly are not very good at using these technologies in the first place. 

But second of all, we say that seeing your children's face once a year isn't enough for these elderly. 

So what have we told you under government? We've told you that first of all, they need physical help right, they can't drive to the supermarket because it's so far away, or they have health issues that keep them from getting around properly around the house, and so on, and we think that this sort of physical help is uniquely achieved under our side because you're able to live under the same roof, which means that you can help them around the house or help them get the necessities that they need, and so on. 

But second of all, we also told you about how there's emotional help right, you're able to live in a comfortable environment with people that you care about, the people that care about you, and you're more likely to talk about your health issues and so on, and we think that that's a unique benefit that comes under our side that cannot be achieved under opposition.

The second of all, let's talk about the children opposition told us that there's going to be sort of extreme dependency, but first of all, we don't see why that's necessarily bad right because the children were also taken care of by their parents when they were younger. And we think that we don't see why they shouldn't be doing that once they become older right. So we think that because these children were dependent on their parents when they were older, we think that these children are justified, and these parents are justified in depending on their children in later life.

But second of all, all the cases that they talked about, like, even though the web speaker brought up most of them, which is pretty late but we think that those are mostly extreme cases right. 

So together we've told you that three things that are like three benefits of the children. First, they'll be able to take care of their grandchildren.

And second, that the sort of, they will have this sort of regret, and they told us that that's not going to happen. But we didn't see why because we think that this regret comes from being unable to save them or help them when they needed it the most, if they live far away. And we think that that regret will be better under our side. 

And we've also told you the relationship between the generations also become better under our side, no response on that point. 

So we think that overall, the elderly will be saved by this close proximity to their children, and we think that the children can also have a better bond with their parents, very proud to propose.
