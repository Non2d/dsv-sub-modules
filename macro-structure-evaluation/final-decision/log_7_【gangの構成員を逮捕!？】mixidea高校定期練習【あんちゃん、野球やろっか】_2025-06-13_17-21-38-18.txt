# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #7 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

# Debate Transcripts
## Government 1st
We live in a world where you have around 10 people in the streets of Chicago or New York holding a gun or with a lot of tattoos on their body, perhaps even holding certain weapons. But the police isn't currently authorized to look after them or prosecute them based on the law, that it is not, like, not, it is okay for them to be a part of gangs because there's no evidence that they have committed a crime.

We think that the importance and the purpose of the criminal justice system is to not just prosecute current crimes. It is also to prevent and deter the occurrence and actions of crimes. And we say on the proposition that criminalizing gang membership is able to deter current crimes as well, but also future crimes, and we think that's the burden we have in this debate.

How do we define what a gang is? Three layers. First is that we think the gang is when a member collectively identifies and adopts a group identity, and they create an atmosphere of fear or intimidation. This could look like holding a lot of tattoos, Mr. Speaker, where you collectively identify through group tattoos or any kind of weapons or certain weapons or certain drugs. Secondly, we define what a gang is when the purpose is to literally pursue violence in a crime as a whole organization. And thirdly, we say that in the case that we criminalize gang membership and the police is able to prosecute certain members by identifying that they were part of a gang, we're happy to put them through extensive rehabilitation at the moment in which they still don't have deep ties with the gang yet. In case that they are deeply involved with the gangs, we'll make sure that they go through rehabilitation and they're not part of gang culture, such as in countries like America, and make sure that they cut absolutely every single tie with the gangs for the sake of crime.

With this in mind, I'm going to talk about three things. First, I'm going to talk about the criteria to criminalize. Secondly, I'm going to be talking about why this is a just and necessary policy. And thirdly, I'll be talking about why we decrease crime.

Quickly, on terms of the criteria to criminalize, we say that if we prove this criteria applies for the sake of gang membership, we should take this debate. We think criminalization comes with two metrics. First, is that if we ensure that criminalization is able to deter the occurrence of crime. That's why, for instance, we criminalize guns in a lot of nations because we think that guns are deeply correlated with the actions of crimes, even when guns aren't literally the sake of crimes. But just because in terms of correlation, we think that when criminalization deters crime, we think that is okay. 

And secondly, we think it is important to protect the sustenance of society and make sure that society is a more safer and more sustainable place for innocent citizens to live on. If we prove that criminalizing gang membership is able to deter crime or prove that society is going to be a better place, we should take this debate.

With this in mind, I'm going to talk about my positive manner. First, let's talk about why this is a just and necessary policy. I have two layers in this argument. First, let me contextualize what gang members first do. We concede that membership does not equal violence, Mr. Speaker, but we say that gangs are inherently about committing violence and committing crimes.

I think that the fact that you are trying to opt into this cycle, in this organization of violence, in and of itself, is self-indicative of the fact that you are interested in crime. That you want to commit crimes, or you want to steal someone, or you want to brutally murder someone, or you want to rape someone. I think the criminal justice system is there in order to prevent any incentive to commit crimes, and we think that on our side, it's more important to stop before actual casualties happen.

How do we see this in the current status quo? It comes like we prevent strangers from lurking around schools because just the fact that you might be a pedophile isn't necessary, and trying to prevent it before any kind of pedophile takes action on a children, in and of itself, is important. 

Similarly, we think this is analogous to this motion because we say that in the case of gangs, we think just the fact that there are gangs is enough evidence that they're probably going to commit crimes in the future, and we want to prevent any kind of casualties from happening. We think that based on this, we think we should win. 

But the second layer is that we think that there's many cases where usually youths or juveniles are coerced into this system. Given this, we think our side is going to be much better at preventing coercion. Why is this? Because we think the coercion by force, in and of itself, is firstly an unjust principle, that we should allow these people who have to coerce by using this illegality and this criminalization as an excuse to prevent entering these gangs in the first place. We think that given that youth and juveniles usually enter gangs because of this mild nuance that like, hey, being a part of a gang is cool, especially in countries like Mexico or Colombia, we are able to prevent this because we think that by the state in and of itself saying that gang membership is something illegal, that it is dangerous.

We think that youth and juveniles, first of all, won't have any incentives to go on, but secondly, they won't be able to be coerced as much because these other gang members know that they themselves are in a predicament where they can be arrested and have their futures taken away. So given this, we think that it is just and necessary because first, we have to prevent future crimes and deterrence. And I think that the fact that you are in a gang means that you're more likely to commit a crime than not doing so. 

And that the comparative is that it's too late on their side because you can only arrest gangs at the moment in which they do commit a crime, where there are actual casualties, where there's going to be raped victims, murdered victims, or any kind of casualties in general. Taken. All right.

<POI> So if you're going to say that criminalizing is going to be a deterrent, why there are a lot of drug smugglers or doing other frauds, even you're a minor, and even you're going to be arrested if you did some of these kind of things, what do you think?

Let me talk about my case about why we decrease crime, and I'm pretty sure that's going to be self-explanatory. Two layers. First, is that we actually reduce gangs in the first place. And I'm sure just in the POI, opposition might say it has no effect. The reason why this is effective is for two reasons. 

First is because I think the fact the state is saying that it is dangerous in and of itself is important. They talked about in the case of scams, but we're able to decrease that because we're saying that even trying to be a part of an organization that does scam in the first place is bad. Given in the status quo, there's not enough deterrence. We think our side is just like an enhanced version of this. 

But secondly, it's because I think that on our side, like there's a lot of cases where police can't do anything, even when people are on motorcycles or holding bats. But on our side, we allow the police to prosecute them at any moment when they are suspect of being a gang. Why is this so important? Because we think organized crime is more important than individual crimes. The fact that youth and juveniles, this is going to be more like magnitude of crimes because just in terms of influence and money and authority, we think the gangs are much more dangerous. 

And this is the comparative that on their side, they can't do anything. They can only arrest people based at the moment in which they do commit a crime. We want to prevent future casualties and bury them.

## Opposition 1st
The government side talks that as if we're going to criminalize something, that all kinds of crime is going to be prevented. We think that these things, well, if we can do it, we think that it's good. But even now, in the present situation, even if you criminalize some kind of like drugs or drug smuggling or like fraud, it doesn't be a deterrent. Rather, it's going to say that these cases are going to increase on the case of like minors or others. And actually, we think that it's going to actually harm the society. That's actually why we're going to say that we should not criminalize gang star membership because we want to protect the future of the minors and others.

All right. Before going to our argument, I'd like to talk about, I'd like to say about two things. Well, firstly, they say that these kind of people who are a gang member, it's the people who are going to do future crime, to rebuttal here. Firstly, this is actually one of the stigmatization, right? If they say that as if all members of the gang member is going to commit a crime, we say that this is not true. Because there are a lot of people like the people who are doing like cooking or like others, it doesn't commit a crime. 

Or like, secondly, we say that other people, and secondly, we say that it is very vague until who you're going to punish. It is very vague for it. And we think it is unjust to punish something, even the criteria is very vague.

We'd like to go to our argument because we've finished our point. Alright. Going to our argument, we have three things to talk about. Firstly, we'd like to talk about the fundamental ideology of punishing individuals. Well, firstly, as our stance, we'd like to say that we are going to welcome punishing the gang members who committed the crime. We oppose punishing the gangs who didn't commit the crime. For example, the cooks or the people who are like cleaning the room or like, yeah, these people doesn't commit harm others or doesn't did something wrong. And some people also didn't know the truth that they like cleaned the room of the gangs or like death. So we think these things are unjust for three reasons.

One is that there are the cases that you didn't know, for example, the Yami Egiro Mondays or like other cases. Even these people don't know. We think that some kind of like cooks or like other people are going to like be criminalized because you did something for the gangs or like other things in their paradigm. Right. We think that it is ridiculous because they did nothing wrong. They didn't kill anybody. They didn't rape somebody or like death. But they're going to be punished. We think that it is unjust.

Secondly, we say that the criteria and criteria is very big. So we think that it's going to isolate these people because if we say like other people want to help these like people who are in the gang and they want to go out of the gang. However, if these people are going to like help these individuals in the gang, maybe the police are going to have those like stigmatization that the people who are related to these like gang members or have the possibility of being a gang membership, we think that these people have the possibility to be punished. And because of this, the other people are going to have more hardship to help these people. Right. We think that because of this, we think it is actually not going to be a deterrent, but rather these people are going to be in these like gangs and no one is going to help them. We think it is. It is very harmful.

Actually, the third reason is that principally we think that if you're if you did something wrong, we think that these people should not be punished. For example, if you did something, if you didn't kill somebody or if you didn't do some kind of crime, we think that these individuals should not have any kind of any kind of like punishment or like death. Right. And people have the right to have and have the right to not to have like criminalization or like others.

We would like to talk in our second point. All right. Our second point is the rehabilitation just needs to infect the underlying and underling to cause more crime. All right. So firstly, now in the present situation, we say that the rehabilitation just just for these individuals to do more like work or like the simple work or like other things. And it's not going to be a fundamental solution for this. Right. And moreover, we think it is causing more harm because even though even now there are two people. One is the people who have rehabilitated. Second is the people who had not rehabilitated. Even they did all the terms of the rehabilitation. We think that these two people are existing.

However, even though there are these two people, these like the companies or the corporations are not going to accept these people because they're going to prioritize the main value or other things. And we say that these profit speakers are going to know, going to try to see what kind of crime, what kind of things they didn't have, including these like criminal records. So actually, if they become an applicant, these corporations, it's actually not taking, not going to adapt these people into their companies.

Actually, this rehabilitation is not working well. This means that these people are going to be excluded from society. What's going to happen? We say that these criminals are going to have more unionized cases and they are going to do more crimes because they don't have any weight or like any kind of like work that we think that these people have more possibilities, that they're going to commit more crimes, more or like make more like organized crimes or like organized gangs. And actually, we think that this is going to make a vicious cycle, which leads to more crimes because these organized gangs are going to do more crimes because they want to have money like drug smuggling or like others. And we think that it is very harmful.

And surely we like to talk that how these things, it's not going to, and even now, even though they are going to criminalize, we think that this is not going to be a fundamental solution because if it's going to be something like an organized crime now or like in the future, we think that the people who are going to be arrested, it's only these like the underling, which is the lower position people who have this, who are the minors or like who are the low position members. And we think that these people are going to be arrested. But if it's going to be an organized crime, it is very hard for to know who is the top leader or where is the top leader now. And we think that because of this, these people are going to put all of these crimes to these lower members people, and these lower members people are going to make more crimes in the future.

That's actually why we're going to say that these things are not never going to be solved, and it's going to increase the crime. That's actually why we're going to oppose. Thank you.

## Government 2nd
So first, I'd like to state the purpose of taking this motion. So, why we want to criminalise? It is not because we want to exile the criminals or the gangs from the society, but our purpose is to help those criminals or the gangs rehabilitate and get back to the normal society. And the second purpose is to prevent the future crimes. So, that is our purpose.

And also, the opposition side said that the criteria for determining the gangs is vague. However, as the first piece of clearly explained, what gangs are, and which is that the group, which is the gangs, is the group where they encourage both directly or indirectly committing crimes. And because of this clear criteria, the judge, we think that the judge is also capable of determining whether a group belongs to the categorisation of a gang.

And, okay, so next, I'd like to revert to the opposition side's claim that this motion will not act as the deterrent. Well, even though the opposition side said so, as the first speaker clearly showed, there is a clear step that, by taking this motion, gangs will decrease and then eventually the crime number will decrease. And even if we hypothesise that it will not have direct results, such as the decrease of the crime, we believe that it is very important for a country to clearly show their stance.

So, currently, the government stance is very vague. And even though they criminalise the action that the gangs take, they haven't directly banned the gangs itself. However, as we all know, the police are always trying to disassemble those gangs by trying to find those crimes that they commit. So, there's this contradiction between the government and the police. Even though the government doesn't directly say that the gangs are out of law, the police is taking action that clearly shows that gangs are not under the law. And this is creating a confusion within the public, especially to the juvenile, as our first speaker briefly mentioned.

Because the government is standing on an unstable and unclear stance, the public do not have this strong understanding that being a gang member is a crime. But if we take this motion, this will change. Because, well, we know that murdering someone is a crime without conscience, and there's no doubt within it. Because we know, because the government is clearly stating that it is a crime to kill someone.

And so, this will apply similarly to this case too. And if the government clearly shows that being a gang member is a crime, even the youngs will eventually know and understand clearly that being a gang member is a crime. And by establishing this circumstance, we'll be able to decrease the number of youngs getting into the gangs, because they think that being a gang member is cruel. So, we believe that it is very important for the government to state their stance, even if we think that this motion will not have a direct effect.

And also, it may be questionable whether a gang member actually committed a crime. Well, it is true that not every single member of gangs does not commit a crime. However, if we compare the possibility of committing a crime between a gang member and a non-gang member, it is apparent that the gang member has a higher possibility of committing a crime. 

And the government's job is to... As I clearly stated in the beginning of my speech, our purpose is to prevent the future crimes. And by banning the action that comes before committing a crime, which is becoming a gang member, we'll be able to decrease the number of crimes, even if we're not sure whether the person is actually going to commit a crime after being a gang member. So, for these reasons, we propose this motion. Thank you.

## Opposition 2nd
So, before I would like to move on to the rebuttal, I would like to add two more arguments. First of all, I would like to make an argument that it is difficult to draw lines that who is a gang member or not. And secondly, I would like to make an argument about the invitation.

As for the first argument, nowadays it is too difficult to draw lines on who is a gang member or not. Even if the gang organization and a person who made a contract or has the same tattoo in one organization and becomes a member, it is difficult to know who is a member because they will hide that he or she made a contract or hide the tattoo. Police cannot search enough evidence that the person is a member or is a gang member. So, it is difficult to invest and arrest them. 

Then, does it have real meaning to regulate or crack down by taking this motion? No, right? Even if we take this motion, we cannot find a person who is a member. So, even if we take this motion, we cannot have real meaning to achieve their purpose.

Secondly, about the invitation. Firstly, they have a bias that gang members commit crimes. But this is not true, right? These days, many people have been invited by strange religion at the university or some other places and become a member of that, right? And this is a problem mostly in Japan. Those people have almost never mind to become a member, right? Because they will have interest by their, like, not, like, they might have, like, saying something about good for themselves by some strange religion. 

But this happens the same in the invitation of gang organization, right? Because gang wants a member to expand their activity. So, if we take this motion, we have to criminalize these people who have less or no feeling to commit a crime, commit crimes, or even become a member of the gang, right? 

So, we have to, the government has to protect them because they are almost victims. Gang wants a member to expand their activity. So, they might, they will invite many people that they want a member of our organization. And maybe, or definitely, they said the member of the gang, gang member will say this organization is not a bad organization. So, if we take this motion, these cases will occur so many times. So, we can't protect them by taking this motion.

We would like to move on to the rebuttal and a little bit of reconstruction. First of all, they think that they can decrease criminals by taking this motion, and they can prevent crimes by taking this motion. But there are lots of gang organizations, and by taking this motion, we might criminalize the member of the gang, a few. But this is much harm more, like, because these people who are arrested mostly are in the low position, as the first speaker has said. So, they have less will to do crimes than people who are in the top of the organization. 

And they, and sometimes the people who are in the low position have strong will, but the less will, the people who have less will are existed. So, if those people are in the prison, those people or more wicked people are in the prison, right? So, we think we cannot put them who has the member of the gang in their old life, right? So, they will return to the society in the future.

As the first speaker has explained, if we take this motion, we will make the network between criminals by having a community with them, right? So, they said that by taking this motion, it is very safe and sustainable, but if we take this motion, will the crime decrease? No, right? Not, because they will make a network and know what's the crime or what's the good way to do crimes by not to know by the police or something like that. So, this occurs that people commit crimes again. 

So, their purpose was to prevent future crimes, but our side is more better, because as I said that it is important way or exacting way to protect this society by taking this, but even if you take this motion, we can't eradicate the real organization. That's the first speaker has to say, right? So, for this reason, we would like to oppose. Thank you.

## Government 3rd
Opposition made the one fundamental mistake that an opposition side cannot do. That is, that they failed in providing a counterfactual, where in their world, gangs are still going to exist, where there's still going to be violent gangs, and how on their side, they are able to uniquely decrease crime. All we got was that, oh, that the concept of gang is very vague, very subjective, but we think that there was no actual critical feedback or any kind of rebuttal coming to a bulk of violent, like the majority of gangs which are violent on our side, how we decrease crimes, and we think the moment in which they failed to provide a counterfactual, they lost this debate.

I'm going to be talking about two issues. First is about the bulk of their argument, which was about this metric of what a gang is. Secondly, I'm going to be talking about which side is able to prevent the occurrence of crimes, and I'm going to be talking about this in a couple of layers.

First, in terms of metric, opposition fundamentally failed in explaining and replying to the majority of the bulk of our argument in our metric, which was that there are a lot of violent gangs, like the Crips and Bloods in LA, or Sinaloa cartels in Mexico, whose literal intent is to commit crimes and create a community of violence. The fact that they didn't respond to this is a concession that these gangs are dangerous, and that we have to stop them, and they concede that in the case of violent gangs, it is necessary to criminalize gang membership. And at the moment in which they failed in replying to any of our argument about this community of violence, we think they dropped our argument that gangs are fundamentally dangerous and that we ought to prosecute them.

But secondly, is that the only reply we got was that there could be gangs that clean up rooms. I think this is a pretty inaccurate description of what a gang is, right? I think the only time these gangs are going to clean up a room is when they murdered someone in the room and they're having to clean it up. But let's assume that these gangs can be so fluffy that maybe their only intent is to hold a tea party and just eat cookies. Let's take this. But we think that this argument still neglects the premise and the incentive of these members who want to enter gangs.

We think the incentive of these gang members is to commit violence, are to commit crimes. Youths who are potentially cursed or youths who are just interested in this slavish ways of violence and crimes. We think that if you want to just clean up rooms, it's much better on the counterfactual, where on our side, we're still going to provide things like regulated government offices where if you want to clean up stuff, you can enter the Red Cross or UNICEF. And I think this is much better on their side, regardless of what incentive there is. It's better than some unregulated, potentially dangerous, unorganized group. We think that counterfactual is good.

Look, the comparison is that even if it is vague, that is not a reason why you have to oppose criminalization. Although, for instance, we do criminalize hate speech in a lot of countries, even if the metric of hate is pretty subjective and vague, we think that this ignores opposition. The reason why we are able to criminalize gangs, even if it is vague, because we think on our side, we include courts in the equation of criminalization, which opposition absolutely neglected. That is that we think the courts are able to at least determine what is violence and what is not through the legislative procedure. And that's why we're able to criminalize hate speech.

And we think this mirrors the logic, and we think that we're able to criminalize gang membership because we do have this final barrier that is able to determine what is violence, what is not. And I gave you a very explicit model in the first place of what a gang is, so it simply wasn't enough. And therefore, 50-minute speeches absolutely drops because this metric of vagueness is not a reason to oppose the criminalization of gang membership. Just in the same way that we have to look at incentive, and we prosecute attempted murder and not murder, but the intent of committing murder is in and of itself important. So the incentive of committing crimes is enough reason of criminalizing gang membership in the first place. Therefore, we think that their whole argument falls.

Let's look at the more important question then, the occurrence of criminalization. Opposition told us three things. First, they told us that companies were important. I'm going to look at this in a lot of ways.

Firstly, we think that in the counterfactual, gangs are going to exist. Given that gangs are going to exist, we think that companies have a certain right to know whether they were a gang member or not. Look, just imagine the top gang of Mexico, which is the Sinaloa Cartel, to be a part of a company of a gun shop, Mr. Speaker. We think that in these cases, they're still going to be much worse because companies don't know they're hiring literal criminals inside their pretty dangerous organization, which holds, handles weapons, for instance. Or just imagine an organization of scammers, of a gang that only commits thieves and burglaries to enter a very important finance company, we think, like Golden Saks, right?

We think that's bad because companies have a certain right to know that they have to protect other employees who are not gangs, and on their side, we think that it's simply, we think that it's good that companies do know if they're gangs or not because that's literally the point of criminalization, right, to ensure the benefit of society. They weren't able to engage with this.

However, let's say that we still want these criminals to employ these ex-convicts, right? Why is this better on our side? Because we think just in the same way we do for juveniles, we could just hide their identity up, that is, that we don't allow criminal, like, companies to give access to criminal records, and on our side, we're telling you that we're going to give rehab, job training, and community sentencing. We think this is more than enough incentive for companies to employ them in the first place. They weren't able to give a counterfactual, and thirdly, I'm going to prove to you why on their side, they aren't able to, like, have effective rehabilitation.

Why is this the case? Because under their side, when these gang members enter prison, they're still deeply tied with gangs, that is, that they have to stay with gangs to survive, especially in countries like America or Colombia, where most, like, most prison inmates are usually gang members, so they're forced to hold ties with gangs, they're forced into a community of hatred and violence, and we think just in terms of broken window theory, which is that if you are in a community of violence, you're more likely to commit violence, we think that rehabilitation isn't effective, because you still have to, you're surrounded by a lot of people who commit crimes.

Just in the same way that if you're holding an anger management class, but you're literally forced into this gang or gang community and seeing, like, a lot of fights every day, we think that rehabilitation isn't effective. On our side, we told you, so we separate them from these groups because we, like, we take them out of the equation of gangs, the moment in which they try to enter, so they still don't have deep ties with these gang members yet, therefore, we're able to prevent them from holding deep ties and allowing them a better integrating society by having a lot of rehabilitation, so we think that in terms of rehabilitation and reintegrating society, we do it better on our side.

Look, the failure of opposition was that they weren't able to provide any reason why, like, the whole existence and allowing and accepting gang members to be in society is actually able to deter crime. We told you explicitly one. I'm very happy for this.

## Opposition 3rd
So first, I'm going to rebuttal the government's side. The government side said that we can hide criminal records, but even if we hide the criminal records, the company cares about profit seeking, and the company's main value. And so, after all, they don't employ employees, so this is not true. And also, we can ask support to detectives or experts, and we can ask the criminal records. So, this is not true.

Then, I'm talking about the arraignment of our issues. First, the government side said that if we take this motion, we can prevent future crime, and protect the society, we're safer. But we think that if we take this motion, young members are must be rehabilitated by punishment. So, in this situation, they may contain the more bad group, and we can know about how to escape those agreements. And we think that they can think of a wiser way to escape this. 

And this is bad effect for society more than to take this motion. And which is better, to prevent crime before they do, or not prevent at that time, but after more bigger crime can be saved. I think that not take this motion is more safety for society. And take this motion is less bad effect for society. Because, I told before, we are company, we become a bad company in the gang member. And so, this is bad effect for society anymore.

And the opposition side also said, if we take this motion, even if we take this motion, we can only find weak gang members. Because, the government side said that government and police officers connection is strong, so we can find gang members really. But, this is not true, because to find those gang members is difficult, because they know how to escape this. And we are always thinking about how to escape that.

So, after all, we can only find weak or not big gang members. So, this is not solve the whole of gang members' crime, and not effect for the future at all. So, not taking this motion is more good effect for society. And also, rehabilitation is give bad effect for them. So, we do not take this motion.

## Opposition 4th
The government side mostly talks about three things. One is that the government should have the staff to oppose gang members, and it is important. But we, and secondly, they say that even, and secondly, they say that we should protect these kind of like societies rather than these individuals. And surely they say that even these kind of like gang members, the ex-gang members are going to be isolated in the societies rather it is better. We actually oppose to these three things.

Alright, why our side is better? We like talking our point. Well, firstly, we actually told us that, we actually listened to them, that why should we prioritize government staff rather than these kind of like retribution or like other things, right? Because we say the retribution, or we say the retribution is just the thing that even there is no like victims or other people, there is no reason that we have to prioritize like other things. Rather we say that we should like prioritize these like rehabilitation of the individuals or like that. We are going to talk about why our side is better. Alright.

And before that, I'd like to do one rebuttal. Well, even now, the government is saying that being gang members corrupts our lives, or we have some kind of like posters or like other things. Why these individuals are not having like, are still going to be like gang members or other things? Because, and it's their thing that if these kind of like posters or other things are being noticed, and all things, it's going to change. What is the difference between criminalizing or like other things? We don't think that there is a clear difference, because even the minors are now doing like drug smuggling, and it is increasing every year. And actually, even if it's a crime, these individuals are going to do because they want to have money or like other, like fame for others. That's actually why we are going to think that this is not going to be solved.

Alright. Moving to our argument, we actually told you three things. One is the rehabilitation moves well or not. Well, actually, they didn't really engage on this point. And actually, they admitted that this rehabilitation is not going to work well, and the corporation or like other organizations are not going to be employed. Alright. And even, and one thing they say is that, well, all right, well, the government can prohibit to have like those criminal, to notice those criminal records of these like companies or like others. But actually, we think that it is very, it is impossible, because these like, as our week speaker told you, that these kind of like companies or corporations, they are profit seekers, and they're just going to know about these criminal records from like other people, from the third person. And we think that it is inevitable. And we think that it's unjust.

Secondly, we say that even we're going to like criminalize, sorry, secondly, we're going to say that it is going to, if this kind of like rehabilitation is not going to work, how these individuals are going to, going to like move for society. We say that if you're not going to be in society, and you're going to be isolated, rather these people are going to be a gang member again, to commit crime, because this is the only way that you're going to live, we think that these things are not going to be solved, rather it's going to be more radicalized, and the individuals, the minors who want to have money or like other like things, who are going to be inside these groups, and rather we say that these kind of crimes is going to increase, never going to be solved in their paradigm too, because there is no rehabilitation. That's actually why we're going to say it's harmful, and because the site is going to be harmed too.

And thirdly, we say that because these like organizations are not going to like fundamentally harm, and so we say that people who are doing like crips or like other people are going to have infected, they're going to be more a gang, and actually we think these things are going to increase more crimes, more things in society, which means that these organized crimes are going to be going to have more, which is going to harm the society, which they want to say, so actually their stance is very vague, because our site is going to say that there is more harm to them. Thank you.

## Government 4th
First of all, I'd like to clarify that the burden in our side was not to prove that we eradicate all crimes, but to prove that to a certain extent, the number of crimes will decrease.

First, I'd like to rebuttal to what the opposition side has said. They said that there are drug smugglers, but we can see that they'll presumably exist on both sides and mutually exclusive. And what we're talking about is domestic gangs who usually hide violent and criminal activities and act tough in public with the police, unable to prosecute them until there's going to be victims. 

And the question raised in this debate was, is this motion going to increase or decrease crimes? The opposition side failed to explain how the status quo would decrease the number of crimes compared to the motion. However, we showed that even if criminals make a more complicated network, this motion will be effective because gangs already have this network. But after plan, it will become easier for the police to catch those networks because the police's capability of finding crimes will be bigger and therefore leading to a more effective way of catching criminals.

If the opposition side was so worried about catching those who haven't committed crimes, then new gang members who want to show that they're innocent shouldn't act tough in public. And our goal is to reduce the number of crimes such as scams and frauds. And why does it specifically have to be this motion? Because gangs are almost always committing crimes and many get away with committing crimes like frauds. And if we let them join a gang, the power of gangs will only get bigger and stronger and better with getting away with crimes.

And we think that the opposition side is too optimistic about the reality. Every year many criminals get away with committing scams and frauds and if we retain the status quo, this situation is not going to get any better. And we on the other hand understand how serious this situation is and how this motion would help the gangs rehabilitate and learn about how they could actually earn money without damaging other people in society. And we also want to say that because to compare the status quo and the motion, we want to say that the damage done to gangs is smaller than the damage done to their victims. As we said, we understand how serious the situation is and we want to decrease the number of victims as much as possible. And this motion will help decrease the number of victims, therefore we're superior.
