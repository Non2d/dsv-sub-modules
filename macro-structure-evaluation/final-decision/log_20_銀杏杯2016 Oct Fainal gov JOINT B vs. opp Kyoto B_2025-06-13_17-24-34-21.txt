# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #20 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

## Government 1st
Our goal is not only to protect the nation, but also to fight against terrorism. So, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor for me to be here and speak. 

I have three points today when it's there. One, the governmental role is a safe citizen, but safe citizen doesn't mean who will be paid and what is good. The second is that this plan, so the payment paid for the terrorists, it means the opposition side of them. Opposition side is totally against our governmental role. Without it there, this plan certainly contributes to our governmental role. 

So, let me explain it one by one. So, before that, I have to define this motion. This House means that the all government. As the government told us, we criminalize the payment for ransom to the terrorists. So, terrorists, please imagine about the islamic state and so on. 

So, let me move on to my point. First is our governmental role. We, I think that maybe in this debate that safe citizen is the consensus of the state base, but safe citizen, what does it mean? It's completely different in these two sides. So, maybe they said that safe citizen means that safe office, but this is individual. Our means of safe citizen is the safe mass citizen. It's not individual, but societal level.

So, we government put priority on the mass citizen, not the individual citizen, because the governmental kind of role is making the happiness life of the whole nation. In order to achieve this goal, we have to set up the easy and peaceful society. So, if the system of society will collapse, we'll never get the happy life. So, in order to set up the healthy society, what we need is the citizen. So, mass citizen, not individual. In this point, we put the priority on the non-individuals, but the mass. And so, the society system means that, so only we go shopping in the town or exciting music labs. So, go peacefully and go overseas like that. We can enjoy ordinary daily life. I think that's the ultimate happiness in this world.

However, the second point is that the payment for the long-term is certainly against this goal. Why? So, A, is that, pay for terrorism group is that, it is a tax to the government to put on this kind of list. Because once we pay to the terrorists, they'll recognize "Yes, we can keep sleeping from this government, we can get the money."

Why? Why terrorism group do kidnapping or get hostage means that they want money. So, ISIS and so on, it's a very isolated organization. So, they are very struggling to deal with that money. So, in order to get money, they kill a kid, kidnapping, get hostage and again and again, and get money from them. So, if they recommend that our government, from our government, they can derive the money, so they do again and again, so that this kind of list of being hostage will be certainly equal.

The second, so B, is that, to get money is that, it means that to cooperate to the terrorism is certainly best. Because, so this kind of terrorism is that, certainly outside social group, so that it try to destroy our peaceful or healthy society. Because, also, also, also, and give them use that, so give them the money to buy weapons or payment for the, payment for the terrorism and so on, so that it certainly be a power to the IS. So, in two points, payment for the terrorism, it is certainly against our governmental law to save health and society.

However, third point. So, this plan can be solve this problem

<POI> So do you mean that you want to make those victims of ransom? So you neglect those victims of kidnapping rather than potential hostages? 

So, one is that, so, so after our friends do that, that this kind of list of hostage should be certainly decreasing. 

The second is that, we, we actually clearly know the payment, but other kinds of ways, for example, so a few years ago, so when our Japanese, Japanese hostage by, hostage by the ISIS, we are co-operated by the Turkey government or closed, closed citizens and we try to save them. And it's like this kind of the way we ordered it. 

And the third point is, even if actually we cannot, we cannot actually succeed in this kind of, succeed, but, even though, but, rather we prefer, prefer order in the mass citizens rather than individuals.

So, third point is that, after taking this proposal, A, the, the list of the target hostage is certainly decrease. Because as I said, so the intention of the kidnapping or hostage is the money. If they recognize that, even though we do kidnapping or hostage, we cannot get that money, can stop them such kind of an inefficient way. Because they cannot get money. And succesfully we can decrease the future number of victims of the hostage. 

The second B is that, to equalize the ISIS, their money, so that, it's definitely equalize their money to buy weapons or salary for the army, so it's the same, so ISIS can get weaker and weaker. We can, we can destroy the society's threatened power itself.

## Opposition 1st
Ladies and gentlemen, in order to save citizens from mass attack, we should introduce this plan. But ladies and gentlemen, that is a strange story and an indirect story. Why? Because we can prevent a mass attack for citizens by terrorism by a more direct plan. For example, airbombing or government restriction directly to the terrorism. For example, actually, we're doing some scheme to the terrorists in ISIS by, for example, airbombing and actually killing readers of ISIS. Actually, they're weakened by airbombing. So actually, we do work by a direct, more direct plan. It cannot be the reason to criminalize payment for ransom to achieve a government-side goal.

We think that the opposition I said was that we should save those who kidnapped by paying ransom to terrorism. And that is really important as a government, as the parents. 

I'm going to explain in the first bit, thank you, about the opportunity to save those who are kidnapped, and secondly, about freedom of choice of those who pay ransom.

Let's move to the first point, which is about the opportunity to save those who are kidnapped. So, under the status quo, why terrorism groups are kidnapping people, or we can see that they're generally kidnapped by ISIS or children, innocent children are kidnapped by terrorism. So, after that, in order to save them, the other people, or parents, or partners, or sometimes the states state themselves that pay ransom to terrorists. And that is the only way to save the children, or those who are kidnapped. Of course, for example, we can find a case, a Japanese case, a Japanese journalist kidnapped by ISIS. When the Japanese government denied paying ransom, they are killed, actually. 

Ladies and gentlemen, but if they pay ransom, certainly, actually, they can save those who are kidnapped. For example, in the Spanish government, or the European government, or the same journalist, by paying ransom to ISIS, actually, we have the case. Actually, it's reasonable to say that the kidnappers, if we pay ransom to them, those who are kidnapped are released, and actually, we can save them. No, thank you. No, thank you.

After taking this plan, what will happen? Even though those who pay ransom have no responsibility for the children, for the partners to be kidnapped, but they are criminalized to pay ransom. And after that, what happens? Of course, they cannot pay ransom, or sometimes terrorism kills the people. And of course, the terrorism is no use demanding ransom to the people, ransom to the victims. But they need money, so actually, that's why they do ransom. 

So what will happen? So they start human trafficking, they start organ trading. By doing that, by any means, they want money. So they do inhumane things more overall. 

So actually, what will happen? Even though we can save them by paying ransom, they won't be saved. They will die, killed by terrorism. The important thing in this argument is that paying ransom is a certain way to save those who are kidnapped, I mean the innocent people. And that's the importance in this first argument. So one of the priorities is not only the mass, but individuals. 

Ladies and gentlemen, of course, we need to protect mass citizens from bombing. But I mean, I say that in order to save mass citizens from a terrorism attack, we have a more effective plan, for example, air bombing, a more direct plan to do that. So really criminalizing the paying ransom is too far from their purpose. That is why we shouldn't criminalize paying ransom.

Let's move on to the second point, which is freedom of choice. Where freedom of choice is important. Let's look at two things. 

The first is whether it's a rational choice or not. The second is harm to others. First, the rational choice. In the case of children kidnapped by terrorism, for the parents, children is a really important existence. So even if they pay ransom to terrorism, as the parents, they want to save their children, because the parents have the duty to protect their children. So that is the rational choice, to pay ransom to terrorism.

And second, in the case of the government, if the government pays ransom to release those who were kidnapped by paying ransom, is it also we can say that it's a rational choice? Because as the government, it's the duty to protect citizens, and save the citizens from a serious situation. So we can say, also in this case, we can say that it is a rational choice. 

And let's move on to the second point, which is harm to others. Of course, firstly, we don't know how to use them. We don't know, of course, it is uncertain that the terrorism, how the terrorism use their money to get from their ransom. 

Moreover, they commit crime, they commit human crimes, as I say, kidnapping, because they need money, because of lack of money. Or if they have enough money, they don't do that. It's a risk, it's high risk to be arrested. It's high risk to be, it's organization. So we can say, we can assume that because they don't have much money, because they need money, they start good human crimes. After, if we paying ransom, enough ransom to those terrorism groups, totally, when we say totally, because the kidnappers, I mean terrorism, lose the motivation to have a risk. So totally, we can say these cases, inhuman cases will decrease. And that is why we put this point.

## Government 2nd
Today's opposition side said that we must save the victims of kidnapping, but we want the idea that kidnapping itself will disappear. So in order to achieve this goal, we must take this motion. Only opposition side paradigm will not erase the kidnapping itself. 

Firstly, let me speak to my previous speaker. Firstly, he said that we can surely save the victims of hostage if we pay the money. But it's not certainly because, for example, I guess IS people's kidnapping, when the kidnapping occurred, the movie was thought that even if we pay the money, the terrorists will not surely release the hostage because they are malicious people and do not always save the hostage.

Secondly, he said that terrorist group will try to earn money with other ways like organ transplants and so on. But who will sell the organ? Even if someone sells the organ, the difference is that the money terrorists can earn at one time. We think the target of terrorist kidnap is mainly journalists and they demand money to nations because nations have much money and terrorists can get much money from the nation the most. So the kidnapping and demanding the money to nations is a very unique way for terrorists to earn money easily. 

So let me move on to my arguments. There are two arguments. Firstly, let me reinforce my partner's argument about undertaking this planned program. And second, why we can justify this motion.

Under the status quo, kidnapping of hostages will never disappear as my partner told you because kidnapping can get much money easily. For example, a bank robbery is very risky for terrorists because a bank is very high security and one person is not so secure. 

But after taking this motion, kidnapping will disappear or at least will certainly decrease because nations will never give terrorists money and terrorists know even if we kidnap, we can't get money. Also, journalists who will go to those areas of terrorism, they will care more about their security. For example, they will hire bodyguards and they will be more careful. So the risk will be lower.

Second problem, payment will kill more people. Money given to terrorists will be used to achieve the terrorist's goal by violent way. For example, as my partner told you, much money will allow terrorists to buy weapons, many latest strong weapons. So terrorists will kill drastically lots of people rather than just the kidnapping of one person. For example, sometimes quite a plane attacked the big building and one thousand or one million people died. 

So if the terrorist group got the money, they will surely use this money to the crime because they are malicious people and they are willing to use violent way or crime to achieve their goal. So payment surely kills people. So paying money to terrorism means cooperating terrorism. Government cannot cooperate terrorism means crimes and killing people.

They said that government needs a direct way to save people. But we see indirect murder is also murder. Government must not indirectly kill people. 

Also, he did not explain about the complete way to save mass people. So please give me the complete way to save mass people. 

How we can justify? For example, in case of disaster, many people are injured. We, or doctors, prioritize people who have higher possibility to be saved or higher possibility to be cured. They prioritize more people because they cannot save all people. They must prioritize more people because the more people will be saved, the more people will be happy. So it is the same to this notion. 

Yes, we think that sometimes, even if the death case starts, some individual hostages will die. But if the number, let's compare the number of people's life. One individual or mass, one thousand or one million people, of course, we must prioritize the number of mass people. So therefore, we can justify.

## Opposition 2nd
Their goal was to save, but potentially kill, the mass citizens. And their policy is to criminalize paying ransom to terrorist group.

Okay, if you want to save a potentially killed mass citizens, then why not kill the terrorist groups themselves? I mean, destroy the organization itself. If we can't directly air bomb or directly attack, or have an economic restriction, then we can comparatively decrease the power of terrorist groups. Then if those kinds of power would be decreased, then those terrorist groups could not kill those potentially killed mass citizens, then their goal is achieved. We believe that their policy is not in this goal. That's what I believe.

So, before going to the argument, let me rebuttal first. Before we go to the rebuttals, I would like to analyze actors in this debate. There are two main actors we have to protect. First, it's the individual citizens who are being kidnapped. And second, those potentially killed mass citizens. 

Okay, let's go from the first actor. In their paradigm, in the United States, if the individual citizens were kidnapped by the terrorist group, they have only one way to save those citizens, that is, to ransom them. And they told us that if we can actually cooperate with the government, they can achieve this. First of all, there is no case that we can achieve this. They said that we can actually cooperate, but in fact, those hostages were killed. So we believe that kind of government cooperation is unmeaning.

Why is that meaningless? This is our second reason why we have rebuttals. Why is that impossible? Because the terrorist groups need money. If they need money, and then they have to exclude the government from the hostages, they will desperately kill those potential hostages from the government, and they have those incentives to have it, because they need money. 

So that's why we believe that even if the government cooperates, it's impossible to save citizens just by other means than ransom. So we believe that ransom is the only way to save those kidnapped citizens. Then, if we can criminalize those citizens, then those citizens will surely be killed. So we believe that those individual citizens are important. 

Why are those individual citizens important? Because they are inherent, and they will surely be killed if we don't pay ransom.

Because the second factor is talking about the potentially killed mass citizens, we cannot understand the potentially killed mass citizens. And in fact, there are a lot of victims. We believe that this is not inherent. But in fact, those individual kidnapped citizens are inherent. Those people will surely be killed. That's why we believe that it's important.

So, after taking this plan, we believe that after taking their policy, what will happen? They say that the case of kidnapping will decrease, but we think that is not true. Why is that? Because kidnapping is a rather easier way to save those money. If we kidnap those people, then we can use those people from using or selling those people themselves or use the foreign currency. And there are other ways of taking money other than ransom. 

So that's why we believe that even though we criminalize the ransom, those citizens will still be kidnapped. So that's why we believe that even if we take this motion, those individual kidnapped citizens will not be rescued. 

So, if we do not have any other way, then there is a way of ransom. And if we can pay ransom, we can actually help those citizens. That's why we believe to help individual citizens, we should not take this motion.

Let's talk about the second factor, the potentially killed mass citizens. Their logic was that if terrorists can gain money, they will buy weapons, and then they will kill mass citizens. Okay, there are two logics. And I would like to go through those two. 

First logic was that if they gain money, they will buy weapons. Okay, the terrorist group who purposed it is that they have to kill people. So even though the terrorist group do not have money, they have to have an air bombing, they have to kill. So they have to have their attack on the expense of the group member itself. 

So if they gain money, what will they do is that they will actually use the money for themselves. For example, under the current situation, people in ISIS are poor. So what they do is that they do a raid or they rob something because they don't have money. But if they get money, then they can use this money for a living. And those inhumane crimes will actually decrease. In that case, those victims of that crime will actually decrease. Even those kind of zero-life manufacturers will be safe in that potential.

Second, we believe that in the first place, if we stop ransom, those terrorists will not stop killing people. Why is that? Because their purpose is money and they have other ways to gain money by attacking people. So they will not stop that. But if we cannot destroy the terrorist group itself, those people will not be safe at all. So we believe that potentially killed massivists will be killed on their part in the first place.

Okay, what happens after taking this plan? Because their action is that we destroy the terrorist group itself, and destroy the group themselves, we believe that if we directly attack and decrease the power of terrorist groups, then we don't have enough power to attack the people as a backlash. So we believe that those kind of potentially killed massive citizens will decrease in our part rather than their part. So that's why we believe that the criminalization of the ransom terrorist group is not relevant to the disposal of the terrorist group.

So how about our argument itself? Because we believe that in the first, individuals in the territory can protect them by paying ransom, and this is clear because if you pay ransom, they will lose individuals, and we go back to our case.

Well, I've finished the analysis of two actors, so I would like to compare the two reports. Okay, so as I told you, individual kidnapped citizens are inherent, and if we don't pay ransom, they will be killed.

On the other hand, potentially killed mass, we cannot expect how many people will be killed in the first place, and furthermore, we cannot even understand whether those citizens would be killed. So, I think, we don't think that amount is important. 

We believe that if someone would be surely killed, and we think that not the potentially killed citizens, but rather the inherent individual kidnapped citizens, saving those people is more important than potentially killed citizens. That's why I believe that we have to save the individual citizens inherently, and we don't think that all of those will. If we pay ransom, we can surely save those people. We are happy to propose.

## Opposition 3rd
Ladies and gentlemen, the important module used today is to save citizens. And we, both sides, agreed, both sides, the purpose was that. So let's compare the government side's view and our citizens' side's view, first. And secondly, in which case citizens can save the citizens more and more and less and less.

So firstly, let's look at the government case. The government case was that they should try to take this motion in order to protect mass citizens from terrorism. Citizens mentioned that terrorism demands money for kidnapping. So, for example, they kidnapped a journalist and they demand money from the nation. And they get much money by kidnapping. And if you pay, we call it terrorism, it should be justified. And terrorism is a strong offense. So that is a problem and potentially kill citizens.

Of course, we can save the mass citizens under the status quo now by directly attacking, airbombing terrorists. That is a more effective and more direct plan. And so that is really superior to the indirect plan and far plan. 

And secondly, we are consintantly saying that we don't neglect its citizens, we save the citizens. And it's also important to look at each one's citizens and save them by paying ransom in a certain way.

After taking this plan, we can't pay ransom for the citizens. Of course, we surely cannot save each individual citizen for kidnapping of terrorism. And also saying that the number of ransoms don't decrease. Unfortunately, moreover, when we look at it, it won't decrease. That is a problem. And so, of course, that is a problem. That's our view of this debate today.

So let's first look at the citizens, in which case the citizens are more saved. And the government side, on the government side's base, basically the government side's view, that after taking this plan, unfortunate story, ladies and gentlemen, the number of ransoms will increase. Why? 

They mention that they kidnap and demand money from nations and get much money. So when they kidnap, after taking this plan, the nations, of course, don't pay ransom to the terrorists. So what happens? 

Of course, they need money. So that is the motivation for terrorism, that they throw organ transplants for profits. Of course, they can get money, but the money they get from organ transplantation for profit is less than they get from nations. So they need to kidnap more and more people to get certain money. So the case of ransom will surely increase after taking this motion, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen. The story that the victims of kidnap will decrease after taking this motion and attacks on mass citizens will desrease is uncertain and far less direct plan and more uncertain plan.

And compared to government side's view, the opposition side's view was that we surely save the citizens who were kidnapped, individuals, we can save them. And of course, we can protect and potentially kill more citizens more by directly bombing, directly killing the terrorists, which is more effective and more direct. 

And because of these reasons, we can save more citizens by not taking this motion. And that's why we proposed it.

## Government 3rd
So in this debate, I have no need to explain how important it is to save the nation because it's the competition. The issue of competition is that of saving the nation. How we achieve this goal is the issue of competition. So let me summarize today about this problem.

Their point is that, one, the sacrifice to the payment. So the sacrifice to payment is the first point we'll come back to. The second is that, due to that payment, the citizens, the neighbors are sacrificing themselves. The third is that if the artists do not vote in a poor, they will stop snatching because they have no need to do it. 

However, it's all not true. First, it is very doubtful that it is really there after our payment.

Second is that it doesn't result in a negative because at present, they are falling in poverty. If they did get the money, they just allow it to collect there, not only attacking. As long as they have money, they use it all, so they need money. They need money always. 

The last point is that it's my point that it's just a cooperative effort until those votes. We can save the individual citizens at that time, but behind that hostage, we expect 100,000.

The second point is about payment. It's that payment, they need a sacrifice. But I cannot say that it's really there, sacrificing themselves, so it's very doubtful. So it's meaningless. 

The last point is that if they are not falling in poor, they do not kidnap, or they are just eager to go so that they do not stop terrorism. These are all misunderstandings. Why? Because at the same time, they need money; they need money always. 

The second is that they are achieving, they are just eager to leave this globe. However, it's not true. For example, ISIS is not one domestic group; it hired many kinds of foreign citizens from other nations. So they need a lot of payment, and they are falling in poverty.

On the other hand, our cases, the most important thing is that we can certainly beat terrorism itself. It's certainly real. We can solve the root cause of the issue, and they are just giving up the solution over time. We want to solve this motion from the root cause. 

So first is that we can see no more expected hostages because we stopped paying them.

The second is that we do not cooperate with them worldwide. We define this time, this house means worldwide, so the world government, so worldwide we stopped to pay them. 

So they are certainly falling into poverty, and they have no need, no money to do terrorism, so the terrorist group certainly collapses. This is the fundamental goal, and it's the only way to achieve the world. Thank you.
