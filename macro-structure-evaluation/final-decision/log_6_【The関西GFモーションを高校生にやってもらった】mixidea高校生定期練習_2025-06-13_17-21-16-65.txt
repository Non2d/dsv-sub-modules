# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #6 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

## Government 1st
What's unique in being a young adult is that you have the opportunity to enjoy your time, and we don't think that it's good for these young adults to look into the far future where they're trying to imagine and throw away and sacrifice all their immediate needs for a future that is not guaranteed. I'm happy to oppose. 

What is our stance? We're not gonna defend a world like what opposition is likely to do and characterize as a world where people are gonna be lazy, they're just gonna procrastinate all the time. We're not gonna defend those kind of extreme cases. We think that our burden in this debate is going to be proving about like people that we're gonna prove. Our burden is to prove that people shouldn't feel guilty about watching Netflix, for instance, as a break. They shouldn't be shunned for debating as extracurricular activities and doing something that might not get them into that. We think that's the case we're gonna be supporting today. We don't think what opposition is likely to come up here and talk about all these lazy people are gonna emerge is gonna be at the expense of this debate. It's just gonna prove to you why there's gonna be important needs to not neglecting immediate desires. 

With that in mind, three things in my speech. First, I'll be explaining why this will affect the health of these young adults, especially when they're in college or around the age of 18 to 25. Secondly, I'll be explaining why this specifically harms these kinds of stakeholders of young people apart from health. And thirdly, I'll be explaining societal harms.

First, let's talk about health. We think what's gonna happen and the contextualization I'm gonna provide and what this defining decade norm is literally people who have to stay up until 4 a.m. studying for exams, people who neglect and throw away their mental and physical health for the sake of trying to gain and maximize these educational values. I think this is extremely bad for a couple of reasons. It's because we think that this success isn't guaranteed. Because no matter how long you stay awake until 4 a.m. and study, we think it rather degrades the kind of quality of education you gain. We think that's gonna lead to people overworking at the expense of their physical habits. And when this happens, we think there's likely to be two scenarios.

That is, one is that in the case of failure or success eitherwise, is that you're gonna push yourself harder. That's literally the reason why so many Asian Asians face overwork or suicide as an example. We think that in these cases, these mental health are gonna be significantly harmed. I think this is gonna be much worse in the case of the long term, which opposition is likely gonna defend. So at this point, we think there's gonna be long-term harms considering this point. 

But secondly, is that you're gonna be more likely to give up once any kind of failure hits you. We think that you're not gonna have any options to pursue because you literally neglected and sacrificed every single other kind of option you had. We think this is extremely problematic compared to our side, where we at least have some other options to fall back on. We think we prioritize these immediate needs such as physical, mental health, or any kind of social bonding. In these cases, opposition is gonna be a world where failure cannot be justified. Where failure is not gonna be justified. And in the case of failure happens, we think there's no gonna be kind of falling back on their cases.

Let me move on to my second point, talking about the most important part of what's gonna happen to young people. We think that the characterization of young people is that they're gonna still rely, they can still rely on their parents, they have the freedom to do something. But in the case of when there's a culture norm that urges people to persistently just pursue life goals, we think that people are gonna lose their capability of finding their identities. That is, the people won't think of taking gap years at universities, for instance. They're not gonna have the option of switching between jobs, for instance. They're just gonna be looking after just one job and trying to stick to that because of this kind of norm which tries to stigmatize idle time and just seek these kinds of instrumental values. 

We think you neglect any kind of the young youthful experience, that is the station you could undergo in this experience, that is like partying, having fun, and I don't know, just enjoying the cultural part of life, right? Not just to try to maximize educational life in your experience. 

When this happens, we think when you go into this kind of defining decade norm is that you're gonna reject any kind of friends because you're just gonna try to gain and reap the benefits you have of social relationships. This is gonna mean that you won't have any kind of a personal connection between people. 

Four impacts of this. First is that there's gonna be, again, long-term no social connection, that in the future you're most likely not have any kind of personal friends because you literally chose your social relationships based on only benefits. That's gonna mean that you're not gonna have any kind of friends or any lovers that you love between each other. We think that in the long term, you're not gonna have social connections. In the long term, we say it's gonna be worse. 

But secondly is that morally you can't enjoy the aspects of youth, right? That when you consider this, when the important part of youth is enjoying your life and trying to find what you want to do in the future, we think it's bad when you go into this norm and you try to just specifically choose one life coach and try to go under this, right? We think morally you won't be able to enjoy this. 

<POI> In your model, you said that you won't defend people who are lazy and procrastinators, but why do you say that this is an extreme case? 

No, so what I meant by extreme cases was you probably talking about extreme cases like NEET. I'm saying that even if people are lazy to some extent, that should be acknowledged and that should be respected as a form of life as long as it doesn't create like massive haybock among others.

Third impact is that in the long term, you're gonna feel left out, right? You're gonna have other people like enjoying life as they were while you are here like not knowing what to do. After you achieve the life goal in the first place, we think you're gonna be left out. That in the long term, you're gonna actually regret the decisions you had by going under going this kind of norm. 

But fourthly is that when you go under jobs and even in the case that it turns out to be like very crappy, you're unlikely to quit because you perceive that kind of job as your only life goal. You're likely to live a more miserable life under their side. 

With that in mind, my third argument about societal harms is that we think that these people are then gonna think of themselves as just individual benefits. They're just not gonna think about society benefits. That is that in cases of elections, you're likely to not fund unemployment benefits. You're likely to kind of neglect affirmative action for minorities, for instance, and perhaps neglect climate change issues. 

We think what's gonna happen is you're gonna rather prioritize what's gonna happen in the long-term like future and not vote for things that are important to you at that time, right? We think that as a narrative, you're gonna believe that your work will be able to overcome any barrier and likely to neglect the immediate needs that people have.

Three impacts. One is that this could lead to lower birth rates because people won't have any kind of loving relationships. 

But secondly is the jobs are likely to be worse because people are gonna be suffering. They're gonna have to overwork at the expense of trying to do anything. They won't be have time to relax and just enjoy life as it is. 

And thirdly is that just policies will be just worse off because you're gonna not focus on the immediate urgent policies that need to be implemented in the status quo. For all these reasons, defining decade norms should never be protected.

## Opposition 1st
To achieve the long-term benefit for young adults, we believe that young adults do not have enough experience to choose the best decision for themselves. And there will be the habit to give up easily. At this point, we believe that these kinds of norms will make the atmosphere that young adults will be happy in the future and they can make effort and they can endure the difficulty they face. So that's why we believe that there should be these kinds of norms so that young adults can live happily in the future.

First of all, let me rebut their arguments. First of all, about their health. They said that young adults will consume too much of their time to maximize the benefit. How is it? First of all, this is not true. This is because when they harm their physical health or something like that, it can be easily imagined that it will harm their future. For example, they said that people will study until 4 am or something like that. These kinds of things cannot be efficient. For example, if you get enough sleep, the effectiveness will be much bigger.

So we believe that health can lead to efficiency and people will do much healthier behavior when they think of the future. For example, a lot of people drink alcohol and a lot of people do tobacco. These kinds of things happen just to meet the immediate demand. However, we believe that these kinds of things are harming their health. However, we believe that when they think of the future, they cannot do these kinds of unhealthy things. So we believe that people will have much more health benefit when they think of the future. 

The second rebut against is about friends. They said that young adults will tend to only reject friends because it will not be beneficial. However, this is not true. We believe that friends are an important thing for the future. For example, when you get a job, it will be much more beneficial for you if you have a lot of friends. For example, if you have friends who are good at mathematics, you can rely on these kinds of friends. When you have friends, it means that there are a lot of people who you can rely on. And we believe that when thinking of the future, young adults will have friends and will not be like the situation that young adults get all the friends. That's literally my point. 

<POI>If you seek this kind of like trying to have a friend who's good at mathematics, you're likely to throw away the relationship once you don't need them anymore. Why is that good? 

So I think she said that people will just young adults will just choose friends who seem to be beneficial themselves. However, we believe that these kinds of things will not be completely the bad thing because they can have a friend. And these kinds of things will be beneficial to their future. And this is not a bad thing.

Then let me tell our first argument. Our first argument is that young adults will lose the long-term benefit. So let me talk about two things. First thing is about young adults do not have enough experience. So because of the not enough experience, they tend to make wrong decisions when they see back what they have done. For example, they will only think about what they want to do now. And they will behave to meet their immediate demand. For example, like eating or like playing with their friends or like drinking tapioca. These kinds of things will be much more done when they are young without these kinds of defining norms.

And the second thing is that there will be the habit to give up easily. So for example, without these kinds of norms, young adults will be much more or will tend to do what they want to do. And even if they have one thing that they want to do in the future, they will give up. Because to realize these kinds of dreams, it is common that young adults have to face a lot of difficulties. Young adults will only give up when they face these difficulties because they will not think of the future. They will just seek the immediate demand and they will give up when they face difficulties. So why these kinds of things are serious? So when you think about the situation that without defining the norm, in the short term, young adults may feel happiness. However, in the long term, there will be a habit to give up.

And these kinds of things will lead to low quality life. For example, when young adults do not study enough, they cannot get into a good university. And they will have difficulty in getting a job because the academic skills are now in society a lot prioritized. So they will have difficulty in getting a lot of money and money will lead to less choice. So a lot of choice will diminish because of the less of the money and less of the effort of themselves. For example, like buying a house, marrying, having a child. However, with these kinds of defining decay norms, there will be atmosphere that you will be happy in the future if you make effort now. Because of this atmosphere, young people can endure the effort and endure facing difficulties. In the long term, they will feel happiness because they can do what they want to do. They can do what they want to do, what they have been since they were young. Thank you.

## Government 2nd
First of all, I will revert their argument. They argue that it's okay to discard relationships because focusing on the future will lead to long-term happiness. However, this neglects the uniqueness of the defining decade norm, which emphasizes sacrificing immediate norms for the future. This is serious because individuals, driven to be future-oriented, may become too busy with studies or work, leading to strained relationships and friendships that cannot continue.

Additionally, I support the argument that only the younger generation has the right to make choices. Young people, being at a stage where they can choose between studying and working, have the freedom to decide. However, as time passes, decisions about the future become more rigid, and the spirit to take on new challenges diminishes. If the current situation is wasted, especially for the younger generation, it becomes a serious matter as unexpected events like COVID-19 can cut lives short. Sacrificing efforts for the future might lead to sudden and irreversible consequences, a point of deep sadness for the younger population.

In the long term, the argument about the defining decade norm being beneficial loses its appeal. While it might be advantageous for some to enter good universities and secure financial stability, it may not be great for everyone. The sudden loss of lives and diminishing choices over the years due to rigid life decisions make it challenging for people to find motivation to live in the future. This hardship, especially for the younger generation, makes the defining decade norm detrimental. Therefore, I propose to oppose the defining decade norm. Thank you.

## Opposition 2nd
Okay, a couple of refutations to our opponents before I get into my substantives.

Firstly, we talked about this issue about health, right? If you push yourself too much, you're going to stay up until 4 am, etc., and you'll be in a bad state both mentally and physically. But firstly, as my previous speaker told you, if you really prioritize achieving your life goals or if you really prioritize educational value or more vocational skills, the most rational decision for you to make is to get like a sufficient amount of sleep. So we firstly say that there is a very low possibility that people will go to the like such an extreme case that they sacrifice their whole health, their whole mental state in order to keep studying or keep working.

But secondly, even if we take their best case and say that a certain amount of people do overwork themselves, we still see that the health risks are like equally high on their side as well. And inside the government's world, where people are encouraged and not stigmatized from prioritized instant pleasure, what we ultimately see is like you like spending time on your phone or your YouTube until midnight, or you like staying up all night at a party, or you like going out every day, or spending a lot of your money on junk food, or alcohol or tobacco, or anything that gives you that instant pleasure, right? I think comparatively, if you are going to spend a lot of your like time, like spending, spending my time and money on these kinds of unhealthy stuff, I think like the health risks are comparatively like, there's not much difference in the end, even if we take their best case.

But more importantly, let's talk about their issue about friends, right? So first of all, like they concede in the beginning that they would have some kind of friends, like only it's kind of like friends, because they're good at math or like, that kind of stuff. But firstly, we don't see the unique harm of that because you do have a friend in the end. 

But secondly, we also think that like, just because you prioritize, like your life goals doesn't mean that you wouldn't have like any friends or like any lover whatsoever. I think like a relationship is not about like the quantity of friends, but like the quality. So if you do have like one really close friend or one family member, I think you could still be happy. But then again, we don't see the specific harm of this like whole relationship issue.

But then thirdly, they also talked about this like policymaking, right? How like, we won't be able to fund climate change or whatsoever. But I think that like, as a premise, you prioritizing instant pleasure is what like makes climate change is what makes climate change like an even more serious problem, right? I think the issue like this whole like you prioritizing instant pleasure is firstly like irrelevant from policymaking. I think politicians should be able to look into the future; it should have like a wider vision, right? 

But like, we think that like people prioritizing instant like economic benefits, for example, is a specific reason why there won't be any like green policies for climate change, or like people like not going to quarantine, for example, or like the reason why people vote for like a populist politician is because they're short-sighted, right? They don't see like the long term harm of that, like certain politician getting into place. So in the end, when you think about policymaking, I think that it's far better for you to be pursuing life goals or for you to be like stigmatizing idle time, because I think that's what leads to proper rational decisions as a democratic citizen.

But thirdly, the opposition speaker, the second speaker talks about this issue about motivation, right? How like, if you work too much, there wouldn't be any like motivation left for you to have your dream whatsoever. But like, firstly, we negate the premise that like working hard leads to like a lack of motivation. I think that if you keep prioritizing immediate pleasure, if you keep going out to parties, if you keep slacking off, I think this is what makes you lose motivation for everything. As my first speaker talked to you, like you're the habit of like, procrastinating and the habit of prioritizing instant pleasure is what makes you like look away from these long term goals that you could be pursuing at the same time. So we think that like comparatively within the world with this kind of norm, when you push yourself to work hard, that's when you find new goals that you can work hard for, like life goals or dream jobs that you want to achieve in the future. So in terms of motivation, we also say the side opposition has a higher chance for people to be motivated and for people to be encouraged to keep working.

<POI>like, as a stance, you guys are saying that when the motion literally says you're going to seek instrumental value from social relationships, or you're going to seek more responsibilities at work, and you literally neglect that kind of premise. What does your side like uniquely achieve? Because we don't understand what your side like really envisions.

Well, the motion says, the motion also says that young adults who persistently pursue life goals. So I think this is also a stance that we can protect. 

Of course, we'll be talking about like you maximizing educational value and stuff like that. But this one ties into my substantive, which is the comparative, why our side is better. So what we exactly see inside opposition is like, as I said, like you maximizing educational value. And this means like you gain lots of skills, or you make like important relationships within like a lot of industries that help you in the future, right? Like if I get like a couple of examples, maybe you take like online courses for vocational skills, like after you come back from work, or you make like acquaintances in like different industries, or like different companies, or you like climb up the social ladder at a very young age and gain a lot of responsibility and gain a lot of like connections, or like overall, like rather than wasting off that Friday night to go drink and go to karaoke, stuff like that, you will study for like a degree for like TOEFL, or you learn another language, etc. So all in all, you won't be resting much, but you also be gaining a lot of things in the time that you have. 

And we think that this is very beneficial. First point, the unique thing about this being a norm is that like encourages people to work hard, right? So in the end, you don't need anybody to tell you to slack off, it's really easy for you to procrastinate, and to like not like to seek instant pleasure, because that's your like natural instinct. That's why you specifically need a norm that like suppresses your natural instincts, and tells you that it's important to work hard, it's important to have a long vision, like and to seek for your future and for like future dreams. Because like, this is something that really pushes you to work for like an uncertain future.

We told you, like as our first speaker told you, young people don't have the capability to look into a lot of things, and they're not like rational enough. And that's why it's really easy for them to prioritize that kind of partying or that instant pleasure. That's why we need a specific norm that goes against their natural instincts, and tells them that if you work hard right now, you'd be like, you'd be happy in the future. 

Because right now, like we live in a world where people can live up to like 100 years, right? Like after you retire, and after all those like many, many decades that you're going to come, would you rather have like no money at all? Or would you rather have a lot of money saved, a lot of like connections built, like a lot of job opportunities that you gain in your life, etc. So overall, we think that like this widens your opportunities. So it really takes time for you to know what you really want, like your dream job, or like starting a company, for example. But once you do have that goal, it's really important that you have enough money, you know, you have enough connections to achieve what you really want to do. And you only learn these kinds of things by like trying different skills, or by talking with different people. So overall, because on our side, you gain more important life experiences, but you specifically need to have to make a habit while you are young, we're very proud to oppose.

## Opposition 3rd
If we make more effort with long vision, the opportunity increases, and in the future, a possibility to enjoy more will increase. So we are happy to oppose.

First, I will talk about why they have more harm and second, the crash point, immediate happiness or the future happiness and the importance.

First, about why they have more harm. They were talking about they can't enjoy in the present situation and they have to feel more pressure, and they will think about only their individual profit. It's bad for society too. However, as our speaker said, if they only think about individual benefit, they will get more matter for health and also they will feel more importance with other people and those friends. Both of these affect the future. If we make more effort and get a good future or get a good job and those things, if we can make enough money, we can afford to be loved and make children and those things. 

As our first speaker said, if we don't, this makes a habit of easy to give up. If this affects the future, their target, the people who have the opportunity to enjoy, they can't enjoy in the future because they have to suffer working with low wage and those hard work, and they will feel like health mental burden. They will lose room in mental. This connects to more lower birth rate because they are not enjoying their life in the future.

Next, I will move on to the crush point. Today's clush point is immediate happiness or the future happiness. If we don't make an effort and just enjoy in the now, having fun with friends, only having fun and those things, they will have a low possibility to go to college. They can't get a job, and they will get a low wage, or they will suffer their life from 30s and 40s. They will have to suffer their rest of the life. They have to think about more of the money and those things. 

However, if we make an effort now, we can get more opportunity to go to a good university and have a good work, and it connects to good salary and stabilizes their life. They can enjoy the rest of their life. Even if they suffer a little when they are young, they can have fun when they are an adult and have a child or those things.

The importance is people tend to go to easy ways. If we make this customary from a young age, this habit will be forever. If we accord with norm, even if we feel a little harm in the short term, but if we make the effort in the future, the choice will, the opportunity will increase and the possibility of happiness will increase. Young age is like 20 years and 30 years, but in the future, we have to live 70 or 80 years. We must raise more awareness. We oppose this motion. Thank you.

## Government 3rd
I think it is very easy to take rid of time regarded as needless. If you seek for the maximum profit of yourself, you can just stop making love with your girlfriend or making a relationship with your friends, and their true meaning. Because you cannot find any educational or social value by loving or making a relationship with her or him, and you can also say that, "Oh, in order to get a higher status and job, I should overwork in the long term rather than prioritizing our health in the short term."

But we think that these things cannot lead these young people to a better future. I definitely think that these things are just going to take rid of individual instinct choices or the individual's true choices, and we think that because we say that these kinds of idle times will be lost, we say that this kind of defining decade norm is going to harm us. So we think that we should think this motion which can lead people to a better future in a true meaning. So that is actually why we are going to oppose.

Okay, but before moving on, I'd like to do some rebuttals. Well, firstly, they have like four big failures. Firstly, they fundamentally neglect the premise of what they're supporting to protect.

And secondly, if young people, they said that young people are irrational, but if the young people are irrational in a true meaning, then we think they're also going to likely to make terrible life goals, right? So we think that their life goal is going to be corrupted in the first place. 

And thirdy, there is no guarantee in the world to go to a good university and get good jobs. It depends on what you did for yourself, right? So it is not defined by fixed concepts or like that. So we think that these things are very needless.

But fourthly, they never prove that these kind of achieving life goals will always like success, right, in a true meaning. Well, we say that in order to like expand their views and for like prepare for these kind of like when you fail in some cases, we say that the idle time should be needed to expand your views like business or like experience or like various friends, not like those like business friends or like that. We think that we should make these kind of like friends in true meaning. That's actually why we're going to oppose.

Okay, I'd like to go to comparison. Okay, so what they said on mostly is that if you're going to have those kinds of norms, these kind of like people are going to have those like, I'm not really sure about it, but rational mindset or like these people are going to have like better life goals and like go to like better universities or like that and like have a better life. But firstly, there is no guarantee that we're going to have a better life in a true meaning, right? Because they say they're like going to have this kind of like lifestyle is changing because we have like 100 years of life or like other things, but we say that because we have a long lifetime, we have to make more experience when we are young, right?

When we are young, we can do a lot of things. We can make friends, not only like business friends, but we can also make friends like game friends or like other like comic friends or like other things. We say that the individual should have the right to make some kind of relationship with them and because it's going to vary through like emotions or like that too. 

But in their paradigm, we think that these things are not going to happen, right? Because they already go pursue only for that social activities or like social values of it. We say that these friends are going to be corrupted, right? You're only going to think about these kind of like business friends, which is only on the surface place.

But secondly, we say that these kind of like other things, for example, for the policy is going to be corrupted because we say the policy will people only see for these kind of like long-term, and we say that these people are going to ignore the short-term benefit. That's actually why we're going to propose. Thank you.
