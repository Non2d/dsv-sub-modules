The Opposition 1st responded with a defense of the intoxication defense, arguing for its careful application similar to insanity defenses. However, they did not specifically address the Government's emphasis on victim harm or the cultural implications of the defense being abused in rape cases.

2. **Opposition 1st vs. Government 2nd**: Opposition 1st brought up the inevitability of some situations leading to intoxication (e.g., work pressures) and the need for a fair judicial system. Government 2nd made some rebuttals, mentioning contradiction in the Opposition's stance regarding responsibility when coerced by bosses. However, Government 2nd's responses largely focus on alternative actions individuals could take, rather than directly engaging with the Opposition's point about the necessity of an intoxicated defense in these specific instances.

3. **Government 2nd vs. Opposition 2nd**: Government 2nd continued to claim that individuals have control over their intoxication and should plan accordingly, tackling the opposition's scenario about work pressure and medication side effects by suggesting personal accountability. Opposition 2nd focused on the principle that intoxicated individuals sometimes cannot control their actions or their path to intoxication, reiterating forced pressures. There was limited direct engagement, as both sides largely reiterated previous points without significantly advancing engagement with new arguments.

# Instruction
Evaluate the argumentative interaction in debate #2 of 20.

## What to Evaluate
Assess ONLY whether teams ACTUALLY RESPONDED to what their opponents said. This is about INTERACTION, not quality.

### What COUNTS as Real Argumentative Interaction:
- **Direct references**: "The opposition said X, but we think Y because..."
- **Specific engagement**: "Regarding their point about X..."
- **Direct refutation**: Challenging opponent's logic or evidence
- **Building/extending**: Developing or countering opponent's arguments

### What does NOT count as interaction:
- **Topic overlap without engagement**: Discussing same subject without referencing opponent
- **Parallel arguments**: Making independent points without addressing opposing claims
- **Generic responses**: Broad statements not tied to specific opposing arguments

### What to EXCLUDE from evaluation:
- **Argument quality**: How good or persuasive the arguments were
- **Missed opportunities**: What teams should/could have argued
- **Potential improvements**: How rebuttals could have been better
- **Alternative strategies**: Whether different approaches would be superior
- **Evidence quality**: Strength of reasoning or supporting material

## Rating Scale:
- **Agree**: Both eams consistently referenced and responded to each other's actual arguments
- **Rather agree**: Both teams addressed most major opposing points with some engagement on minor details
- **Rather disagree**: Both teams addressed some opposing points, with at least one team missing several key arguments in all issues
- **Disagree**: Teams showed limited engagement with what opponents actually argued, with at least one team making arguments largely running in parallel

## Government 1st
Chair, victims of rape and violent assault have not, for so long, not been compensated because of the intoxication defence. When public officer raped women being drunk, knowing that being drunk actually deprives him of the ability to judge reasonably, he got only three months of suspension from his job. He didn't lose job at all, and he was just released after his sentencing for three months. We think simply that's not enough, and we think intoxication defence is illegitimate as a form of defence. We were very happy to propose this motion today.

I have two things to tell you from my speech. Firstly, how the status quo of intoxication defence exacerbates the violent crimes such as rape, and secondly, why intoxication defence is illegitimate and should be abolished from the perspective of the criminal justice system. But before that, several points of model.

Of course, Mr Speaker, we are very happy to inform how alcohol deprives a person's ability to judge and act reasonably, and we think it goes through the educational processes that we are doing right now. We think that before drinking, he should know that his judgment ability would be probably diminished, and we are very happy to inform for those informations. And we also support rehabilitation centres when you're in prison or whether or not you're in prison or not, you can actually go to a rehabilitation centre if you have that alcohol problem, and you'd be better, you should probably feel the responsibility when we abolish the intoxication defence.

But the point is, at the point in which you drink, knowing that alcohol causes you a judgment problem, then you will be responsible fully for the action you do during the time of being drunk, right? So having drunk like that, then you'd be more to the first issue, right? So the status quo of intoxication defence exacerbates the violent crimes. So simply, we think the punishment mitigated based on you being drunk, by mitigating this based on being drunk, victims are not inadequately compensated. They feel their damage, and damage isn't really fully compensated. And also, the criminal also don't really regret the problems that they caused during drunk, and they actually end up causing repetitive crime, and we think this possibility will be higher under their paradigm, right? Yes.

<POI> So what if the individual is intoxicated by a side effect of a medicine that they're prescribed? Your cases are just about specific cases of rape which are rape-coaching criminal justice, and does not accommodate the variety of cases of intoxication, right?

Ah. I'm not sure if I'll answer that, sorry. So why does this happen, right? Firstly, we think that when you drink, you know that you'll be excused to some extent, right? Just like the public officer who said in the court that I was drunk, I couldn't really control myself, and he lost, he just mitigated his crime, and said this, and only stayed in three months. He knows that he will be excused, and at the point in which you drink and you do some stupid things, you know that you'll be excused, right? 

But secondly, socially also, you seem to be excluded, right? The narrative that surrounds this crime, because you're drunk, you're not that as responsible as other cases, right? We think that's a kind of norm that's created through this system, because the state officially recognizes as a mitigating factor and legitimate cause of defense, right?

So as a result of that, two harms happen. Firstly, victims are damaged in the court trial, in the process of court trial, when they hear that the offender says, because of alcohol, I wasn't responsible, right? We think that narrative itself that exists in the court is very harmful for victims to enter the court, and we think that's a double jeopardy for these victims. 

But secondly, also, there is a danger of repetitive crime, right? Please note that the drug rape problem has a repetitive tendency, 60 or 70% of repetitive tendency, right? So if it's because of the alcohol, you don't regret your action at all, because you raped the alcohol and not really blaming the actions and your ability to judge, which is resulting in more and more numbers of victims being raped after sentencing and also after sentencing of offenders, and we think this problem has been so long left in, especially in Japanese society and other universities, rape in cultural society, right?

No, sorry. So we think that's the problem. But more importantly, secondly, why intoxication defense is illegitimate and should be abolished? So we think that this is an illegitimate formal defense that is more bankrupt. So first reason is because, as I stated, right, it's your choice to choose to drink and choose to maybe prescribe the medicine in a situation where you might do something wrong, right? So if you prescribe the medicine, then you should probably stay home for those moments, and probably that is your choice also, right? So meaning that even if you do things while you're being drunk, at the point in which you choose to drink and to actually go into the society knowing that you might be a hanko, we think those persons should be fully responsible for actions, right?

It's totally different from, for example, insanity defense, where people don't choose to be a mental illness or cannot really control themselves, but it's rather the way that you choose to drink, right? So it allows us probably to drink drunk driving, where you probably drink and you drive and you're punished, right? So even if you have multiple judgments, that doesn't mean that you are not responsible for action. You should be punished equally, right? So why is this important at the end of the day? We think this is because the state has the duty to serve for the bitter-bitter justice for victims, right? Victims don't care why you started drinking or started, you know, you lost your judgment ability because of you being drunk, at the point in which those are the ones who didn't choose to actually, you know, to be raped, for example. And like, we think that's, for that sense, we think intoxication defense is immoral as a defense and should not be really justified and for that reason, I'm very happy to support this.

## Opposition 1st
Before we move to my substantive, I have several presentations about our stance. First of all, we are debating on the existence of the concept about intoxication defense. We are not saying sentences for people who have committed a crime when they are drunk should be always mitigated, regardless of context. It's like any other existing defenses, like insanity defense. When perpetrators submit insanity defense as a case to ask for mitigation, there will be careful discussion about whether or not they actually don't have responsibility. If the court believes the application of that defense is good, maybe it should be applied. If the court doesn't think it is, it should not be applied. They cannot simply win this debate by throwing random examples, which sound bad.

Second of all, we don't oppose regulations to prohibit actions when people are drunk. For example, drunk driving is prohibited. We are supporting that regulation as well. There is an expected consequence of it. That's why we are regulating drunk driving or some other actions when people are drunk, but we will support it. We claim the responsibility to not respect that regulation, but we are saying the consequences of things like being drunk or other substances should be mitigated, compared to other, for example, general murders, general damage to individuals, that's the stance from our side of the house.

So from the legal approach, I want to talk about two things. First of all, why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense principally, and I will, secondly, deep dive on specific cases why it is not reasonable to abolish intoxication defense in their side of the house. 

Before that, several independent rebuttals to the Prime Minister. First of all, they provided cases about rape repeatedly. I don't say it's completely irrelevant at all. But problems regarding rape cases are now discussed not in the context of intoxication defense but in the issues about, for example, constant or the factor of gravity of sentences for rape are generally very low. Those kinds of issues are consistently discussed in the current context. We say, they are talking about rape is very lightly treated. It's not about this debate. They need to talk about it in other debates.

And secondly, they are talking about victims. Victims' rights are unrespected in the status quo. But criminal cases don't respect victims' rights to much extent, unfortunately, as a system. Victims' voices are heard as one evidence to discuss culpability, but victims' demands for sentencing perpetrators cannot be heard already in the status quo. If you want to argue some compensation things for the rape victims, it will be another debate about intoxication defense in civil cases. That will be a completely different debate. Then, also, it's the same for insanity defense. Victims don't care that people have mental illness or so forth. But still, insanity defense is there in order to protect the perpetrator's right and prosecute individual in a fair manner. That's the core principle of the criminal justice system.

So let's move on to my first point about the principle why criminal justice should maintain intoxication defense. So criminal justice consistently puts importance on the responsibility of the prosecuting individual can take in any specific circumstances. First of all, criminal justice system is built on a trust of citizens. Every single individual should feel it's a fair jurisdiction under equality of law. That's why people are obeying the law, people are conforming the law. If people feel it's not fair, I don't have any responsibility for this particular crime. That way criminal justice system cannot work in the first place.

And secondly, as a fact, criminal justice deprives the right of an individual to a great extent which requires authority to present undeniable cases saying an individual is responsible for consequences caused by the person without any doubt by the individual. That's why we assume presumption of innocence. In order to protect the right of individual who committed a crime, that's why we put the burden of proof of criminality on the side of prosecutors not on the side of defendants. So that should be consistently working in a status quo. That's why using intoxication defense should stand in our side of the house.

Then let's move on to the specific cases why that should be maintained. So for example, Ms. Speaker, taking alcohol and other intoxicant substances are oftentimes inevitable. For example, when you work as a sales rep for a company, it's really inevitable to go out drinking with customers. It's not limited to alcohol, Ms. Speaker. For example, some general medicines make patients lose consciousness or ability to judge things which they can do in other very ordinary situations. For example, you may receive Tamiflu as a drug for influenza. So in those circumstances, patients don't have any ways to avoid taking those medicines, but they still will use those consciousness or ability to judge things in their side of the house.

But in their circumstances, when they abolish every single intoxication defense, the people who commit a murder for an individual in very normal circumstances and the people who commit a murder when they take Tamiflu are going to be prosecuted in the same way in their side of the house. That is very helpful in terms of fairness for individuals who don't feel like I'm very untreated compared to the person who murdered without any reasonable reasons. That's why we think that should stand before moving on here.

Okay. Tamiflu is taken in the case of influenza, right? You choose to go aside the beings that are severely ill, and you are pushing the hypothetical very unrealistic case for the case of the complete harm of the influenza. I don't understand your point of information. Taking Tamiflu is also the realm of this debate. We are talking about not only about alcohol, we are talking about any other intoxicated circumstances. They need to defend why people who are under the law need to be prosecuted in the same way compared to other people in ordinary circumstances. 

So why is this analysis important? Because one main reason to distinguish intoxication defense from insanity defense in their side of the house was that a person didn't choose to be in that situation. But in many circumstances, even about alcohol, about other intoxicated circumstances, a person didn't choose to be in that situation. For example, they don't choose to be a sales rep. They don't choose to be going drinking with customers. That will be the order from, for example, the boss. That is not controllable consequences for individuals. That's why they are mainly distinguished that intoxication defense from other defenses are already not standing in their side of the house.

And also, we told you, so that's important. And also, we told you, in those circumstances, victims, for example, when customers are punched by those sales reps, don't care whether people are better or not, people are drunk or not. But actually, the responsibility that individuals can take for those consequences is severely different from people who are doing the same thing in ordinary circumstances. We are not saying people should be exempted from any responsibility. There will be sentences anyway in our side of the house. But we say there is a slight difference over that responsibility that individuals can take. That should be affecting the sentences that individuals will receive in our side of the house. For all these reasons, we are very proud to oppose.

## Government 2nd
It was interesting when the leader of the opposition tells us that on his last minute of speech that there are cases when drinking is inevitable. You're being coerced by your boss to drink in order to increase your sales revenue, etcetera. On the other hand, he also told us, look, they're going to be punished anyway. They are sitting in a room where they think they are responsible for the inevitable action ordered by the boss, meaning that it's massively contradictory. They have agreed that there are cases, well, I mean, in their cases specifically, in their favorite cases, that even in the inevitable cases, there are rooms where those people are responsible for their actions. What we argue from our proposition is that their case, what they told us, is not inevitable in any way, but even if they are inevitable, they already made a massive concession by their side that they should take responsibility on the inevitable cases. We don't really understand why. 20% it was boss's fault for me to reduce it, but 80% was, you're coerced, but still it's responsible by yourself. They have to deserve it. We think that is wrong.

I'll talk about two things. I'll talk about, firstly, a brief idea, a rebuttal idea about this. Rape cases, an idea of the main side effect, and secondly, why even in their case, in their favorite, when we talk about this medicine or customer sales, why we think those people are still responsible and should not deserve intoxication defense.

Firstly, what are the cases we're talking about? The first case we have told you that, well, there are the problem of understanding of gender problems, like rape cases, for example.

What we've told from the opposition that rape is not only a problem about intoxication defense, but there are other things that are also involved, when we talk about gender biases, etcetera. We don't deny that. Maybe that is a problem we also have to fix. But also, what we have conceded, had a concession from opposition, is that he didn't deny this idea of gender intoxication defense is one part of the big problem that associates by getting a verdict to defend it, or rape, etcetera.

The problem we have is that there are people who say, well, that person was drunk, so he raped, so he won't deserve punishment. But still, he deserves a less punishment, maybe it's a factor, because it wasn't for himself. When we talk about boss requesting the employees to keep drinking for increasing the sales salary, he said, well, you know, I'm forcing him to drink a lot in order to increase sales revenue. But, you know, partial part of it is something negative, right? Then he's not going to receive a certain less punishment than he actually deserves. We don't think other people should be blamed on that point, right?

What we want to blame for those victims, the criminals, is that it was you who knew that drinking a drug could give you a side effect at that point. You should have asked, and you could have asked, a help to other people. You could have asked your mom to lock up the door so you don't have to go outside or keep bullying other people, for example. You could have had help of your mother or grandfather, any other family members, to be with you when you have to go outside to a supermarket to buy a drug, for example.

So that person can control you when you have used your conscience and may start attacking someone else's, right? There are lots of options that a person could have taken. A person has actually the negligence and said, I'm not going to take any of those options and I'm just going to go out because I want to, right? And I think actually being forgiven a part of it, it was, you know, it was a side effect, right? I couldn't do anything about it. Even though that person could have done a lot of things to prevent that, right? That person didn't do it. We think that person deserves a punishment at that point, yes.

<POI>So your logic was like, people should be punished without any defenses because you made some decision that caused crimes in the end. So why don't you maintain insanity defense because mentally ill people chose to go outside, which caused crimes?

Well, the distinction here is right. This is a huge distinction, right? So when a mentally ill person decided that this person is going to go out, that person, already before going out, does not have a full capability of deciding what's going to happen when they go outside. What are the other viable alternatives that that person could take in order to prevent all the possible harm that could happen, right? That's the distinction, right? Before people become drunk, they're not drunk, right? Obviously, they have certain constants that they control by themselves. That's the distinction between insanity defense or target of people who are mentally ill.

Second case was, look, other plausible case was the boss is going to force them so they have to drink, right? Firstly, the requirement from the boss is an absolute, right? If you're going to deny, it's not like you're going to be killed, right? There are a couple of options you can take. One worst-case scenario, just quit. Second option, just go to a harassment center or whatever, just claim your boss that you've been coerced to do all this alcohol harassment whatsoever.

We think that person are more likely to be told, you should not coerce your employees to drink too much, but that person is going to be squished because there are lots of problems that are associated with harassment and compliance that are associated in any other country or Western world democracy, including Japan, that it's a wrong thing to keep doing all this harassment and we should be nice to those employers. We think that very function as well. There are lots of options that a person can take. And moreover, if that's necessary, we think that boss should also be coerced, right, into punishment, etcetera. That person making those employees lose control by the coercive orders, right? There's lots of options that customers or employees can take. Obviously, it was not inevitable. It was your choice.

And moreover, that person didn't have to keep drinking forever, right? We have to realize that all these problems often happen when the individual drinks often too much over their capacity that they cannot control anymore, right? They have also had an ability to control how much they drink in the vast majority of cases, but they didn't do that. They have realized, what boss told me to do is I'm just going to drink a far lot more than the capacity I can have in order to create all the problems, right? We think there are lots of cases where those people had a control on their mind, but they didn't choose to, and therefore those people deserve punishment. That's why in any cases, intoxication defense should not be allowed. It was your fault. You deserve punishment. That's all it is.

## Opposition 2nd
Two clarifications before we move on to the speech. First of all, what they are trying to prove is that they are opposing the entire concept of the intoxication defense itself. So that's the state of the government's side has to need to decide any cases that's why students need not necessarily to consider about the intoxication defense, even if there is a certain possible existence, it's obvious that they cannot control themselves this kind of situation. Rather, they can provide proof as to why students, in any case, need to abolish the concept of this type of defense itself. 

The second point is that we do not rather than have the responsibility to disperse completely any no responsibility about committing a crime. Obviously, we are more than happy to consider the extent, to what extent they cannot control themselves, the understanding of these things, or furthermore, we are more than happy to consider whether or not they can avoid becoming intoxicated or not, to what extent the harassment by the bossy case, or to what extent they can avoid taking medicine, this kind of thing. We are more than happy to also consider this kind of situation. So, that's the clarification. So, I have one question. First of all, whether or not we can have the responsibility to disperse properly becoming intoxicated or not. 

Before moving on, that's two points of response. So, they're talking about, they're consciously talking about that as a student, we cannot make this sense of rape problematic, people are using these defenses, and they're committing again and again. It's obvious that out of the debate, if this rape is problematic, people are actually intentionally committing crime, again and again, and abusing this type of defense. We are more than happy to also consider this situation. So, obviously, these people are abusing all day, and certain consciousness, we are more than happy to punish them. It's obvious that the debate, what the debate is about, we can just allow the people who became intoxicated, the situation, can have the responsibility about their action or not. 

First of all, they're talking about, the first speaker talking about the rape culture, etc. Two responses here. First of all, fundamentally, it's also nothing to do with us, this motion based on us, it's obviously that defense is at the principle level. Furthermore, we say that the rape culture is obviously related with us, whether or not the court making, particular decision making, or not. So, even if it's a significantyl related to these, and also, after this system, people recognizing that the responsibility or the situation in the toxication, it's rather counterproductive, I think that. Because in such cases those potential criminals may figure out way how to defend themselves by blaming victims. For example, victimes can be thought to know the culture and created the situation and have some responsibility. So, that's rather counterproductive to combtat rape culture. Uh but it's not so much relevant to this motion. But after all, it's counterproductive.

Okay, so, um, okay, moving on to the first issue, my issue, whether or not we can, whether or not these people have a responsibility in the intoxication situation. So, we think that, generally, that these people cannot avoid and cannot control themselves, and actually they are committing a crime, because they are in the situation of intoxication. Two layers of analysis. First of all, before they become intoxicated, whether or not they can choose to become intoxicated or not. So, we think that, because as my partner already told you, it's obviously that it's inevitable to become intoxicated. For example, taking the medicine, or the sudden pressure from the boss's existence. They don't just quit, or just control themselves, etc. 

So, first of all, as I already mentioned, we want to also consider that to what extent this pressure is so huge or not. So, that's why we still recognize that even the power harassment is recognized as sexual harassment, it's problematic. Obviously, some people cannot reject it, some people are forced to do particular actions. So, on that occasion, we also consider that part. 

For example, they talk about that they took the preemptive measure, they do not go outside, etc. Two responses here. First of all, it's from the perspective of the individual who is gradually becoming intoxicated. It's extremely difficult to understand to what extent I am rational, to what extent I am becoming intoxicated, etc. Even taking drugs, or even taking alcohol. So, on that occasion, even still, yes, they believe in that. Maybe I am 30% rational, maybe I do not commit a crime, I do not offend them, this kind of situation. So, on that occasion, it's easy to understand whether I am rational or not, but still, they need to keep their ordinary life. They need to, for example, take drugs, they go to the supermarket, or some situation. So, on that occasion, someone believes, maybe I am not so much, 30% rational, I do not commit a crime, etc. Are they going to do so? Actually, it's obviously not so much easy to take preemptive measures.

<POI>If we pass this activity, don't you think it's more likely, for example, workers can avoid the housemaid, saying that I will never be mitigated, or those people will act more responsibly? 

It's obviously nothing to do with this debate. Because even if the children commit more crimes, they will still be supporting the child's defense over this kind of idea. The obvious thing is that, whether or not people commit a crime or not, it's obviously a different debate as to whether or not we can give a punishment to those people, and whether or not we can consider that in this kind of situation. So, okay. And also, still that they have a certain punishment, a huge punishment in existence, obviously that's workable, as it turns out.

Second point, about the other day, becoming the intoxication situation. So, as I already mentioned that, whether or not they are intoxicated or not, it's extremely important, that's a big metric. Furthermore, if you want to become intoxicated, you cannot consider that so much. What I mean by this, is that if you become intoxicated, you can understand what is the linkage with your action, and what is the consequence of that. So, for example, just people who drink too much, so, punching something, so they do not understand whether or not it's a damage to this something, or also how to damage themselves, this kind of thing.

So, people cannot understand what is the consequence of their action. They can easily imagine that. So, that's why we cannot easily put responsibility on those people, because they cannot understand what is their action, and what are the consequences of their action. It's very much the same as child defense, or insanity defense, these kinds of things. So, that's why they do not intentionally commit crimes. They learn how to accidentally commit crimes. It's not easy to think that this is a responsibility of that person. So, what I told you, first of all, this is a debate about to what extent people have a responsibility. First of all, we think that it's not easy to avoid becoming intoxicated. Furthermore, after becoming intoxicated, people cannot control themselves. So, that's why we propose.

## Government 3rd
Chair, what makes this debate apparently difficult for the government is that we must defend a rather sweeping policy of not recognizing any intoxication defense. It might seem that the degree of responsibility differs between intoxicated criminals and non-intoxicated criminals, so it might seem, according to the opposition, that when it comes to deciding on mitigation, this difference of degrees of responsibility should be taken into account, hence intoxication defense, and the opposition might seem to have a very easy debate here. So that's why they didn't deepen their case beyond self-cultural things.

So the government's burden is to show how this sweeping denial of intoxication defense can be successful, and this burden will be met by how society currently deals with intoxication problems, making individuals informed about the danger of intoxication, and making them capable of making decisions upon that intoxication. The way we as a society view substance intoxication and the way we inform people about it justifies a special case against intoxication defense sweepingly, and that is the point I'm going to summarize in this speech.

So, unfortunately, I have only one flashpoint, which is obviously how we should recognize the difference of degrees of responsibility between intoxicated and non-intoxicated criminals. So the main point was clear from the leader of the opposition, saying that responsibility should be carefully calculated in case of criminal cases because public trust in the criminal justice system is important, and because rights restrictions should always be carefully justified on a case-by-case basis. So the first response to this general argument is that, this is shallow, I think, but the second response is that if trust matters, then the leader of the opposition's rebuttal to our Prime Minister's point about the victims' interests doesn't stand at all because we generally have doubts on the criminal justice system that continually decreases the terms of imprisonment of criminals just because they were intoxicated at the moment, right? So we think if we are carrying all the public trust in the criminal justice system, we think that comes in favor of our case against this kind of defense.

And the second response is against their point about rights restrictions. Any rights restriction should be justified adequately. And we have no disagreement here. This point is, I think, related to a deeper issue that the opposition side presupposed but not explained. Free will or self-control. We say that the degree of responsibility of one's action should be based upon how much reasonable self-control one could have exercised in the process leading to criminal actions, right? So those who lack the ability to act on self-control at any point of that process cannot be punished as harshly as those who are self-controlling. That might be the opposition's case.

And now we have to make some differentiation between substance intoxication and non-intoxication. So how does substance intoxication differ from other cases of diminishing responsibility? So the opposition prefers analogies of mental illness or insanity defense, or more specifically, or characteristically for today's opposition, side effects of medicines.

So firstly, what is characteristic about substance intoxication is that it is necessarily one's own self-controlled choice that one enters the gate to intoxication. So we say that even substance addiction, for example, such as alcoholism and drug addiction, begins from one's choice in the first place. Not only that, the continual substance addiction or the ongoing process of being addicted can be avoided, could have been avoided, by one's own self-controlled choices. For example, going to a cleansing clinic or choosing to be cared by relatives or family members, all these choices could have been made by those individuals. 

And that choice, or that self-controlled choice, was in the process leading to the final criminal action. Note that this is a normal case of any intoxication criminal actions. So the normal case necessarily involves self-control that is as effective as non-intoxicated defendant's cases. So we think this is the massive difference of substance intoxication from other cases, such as mental illnesses because obviously there is no self-control in the process leading to mental illness and the process leading to crimes based upon mental illnesses.

<POI> If your argument is true, do you oppose the distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes? Sorry? So if the fact that you knew it and you opt into it is all that matters, do you oppose the distinction between well-planned crimes and composite crimes? 

No, we don't have to make that distinction because... Okay, let's talk about that later. Okay, let's take the preferred cases one by one.

So this said first, then what about the side effect of medicines? So we think the opposition cannot just throw one possible case of intoxication. They must show that such a case is significantly likely to lead to intoxicated criminal actions that are totally detached from self-control's decision-making. So we think that deep explanation was lacking in the opposition's case despite the fact that they tried to be specific about each case.

Secondly, they said, then what about being forced by bosses to drink? Bassai already responded in his rebuttals, but to put the fundamental point from a criminal policy perspective, we have always warned the public or cautioned the public of the dangers of substance intoxication in our daily practices. For example, we campaign against drug violence. Those campaign posters against drug violence appear time and again in train stations, for example. An anti-drug campaign exists everywhere. Also, Tamifu is already known as dangerous enough to distort your calculation, right? So we have always informed people about the dangers of substance intoxication, and there was a reasonable point at which people could have avoided getting into substance intoxication, and we think that is a good basis for us to judge that these people could have exercised self-control. 

Also, the fact that we abolished intoxication defense will enhance our ability to deal with such problems as forcing and persecution-related problems. The point is that the way society approaches crimes expresses the society's view about how dangerous the token action could be. So the forcing to drink is dangerous, Tamifu is dangerous, and all these evaluations of the opposition's proposed problems do have an impact on how these practices will be calculated upon on a daily basis. And we think these kinds of effects don't exist for mental illness, right? We can't warn people against becoming mentally ill, and we think this is a clear distinction. Enough. We are done.

## Opposition 3rd
So, it's like three speakers saying the same thing, but it's important once again to note that their verdict is proof that this framework should be abolished. Because we have told you that if there are circumstances in which this could be applied, like in cases where prescribed medicine causes a new side effect because you were not being well that day and you did something terrible. It might be that you have a hard drinking session and you did some terrible thing, but it's kind of a cultural thing, you know, cooperation that was unavoidable for you. 

But even if it's your after-choice and you're just drinking and going on with it, these circumstances, you were not yourself. You were not really remembering it, you don't really think about it, and it's that your culpability is minimized. We were telling you that it might be that in some cases they are really responsible, but there are multiple cases where these people do not take the reasonable culpability as compared to where they were rational and not drinking or not being intoxicated by the substances. 

I'm telling you that I think the distinction reasonably exists, this framework should exist. Once again, this circumstantial argument from coming from God, we can deal with them specifically. The question on their side of the house was why they were willing to abolish all circumstances and the circumstances where these individuals were vulnerable were caused into situations because they were telling us that for some minority kind of cases, we were willing to sacrifice other considerations of justice. I don't think that's how justice should work.

Three questions. Firstly, is this policy beneficial or are those benefits justified in taking this policy? Secondly, should the consent on whether you're drunk or not matter in the debate? And thirdly, if I have time, I'll talk about what is important in the criminal justice system. So, rebuttals integrated. 

So, is this policy beneficial or are the benefits justified? So, the main argument is that rape is terrible, we've got to do something, and they're willing to say that rape is so important that they're willing to abolish it if they don't care about the traitor. One, we think that we told you there are numerous alternatives that are equally effective in addressing the situation. We're talking about discussions ongoing about rape culture going on in the criminal justice framework. We're talking about investigations and assessing of situations that are especially in drunk cases being highlighted as Scandinavian nations taking more hard criminal sanctions on rape cases where people are doing active things and trying to get away with it. These discussions are happening and these things are gradually changing. I don't necessarily think that abolishing it would contribute because if you are able to put in specific clauses about drunk cases in rape situations, then they achieve their goal.

So, the argument is best saying that we should abolish intoxication defense in rape cases and not necessarily supporting the motion. Because if it takes the alternative, you don't have to sacrifice all the alternatives, all the trade-offs that we talked about, and people intoxicated at the time of one's sins and get all their benefits. So, I don't know why they're willing to get the trade-off. 

But even if we concede that they can get the benefit, we argue that criminal justice is about inclusivity and assessing the proportionate situation. So, ultimately, your attempt to prize one specific case for the case for the sake of sacrificing other considerations or other situations is against the basic framework of criminal justice. You're abandoning your attempt to be proportionate and inclusive of a variety of situations that considerations are willing to make. I think that there was no response that was so clear and substantive from leaders of opposition. 

But another even-edged case is that if criminal justice is so distorted by offenses or rapes or patriarchal judges of things, this abolition of intoxication would not probably help because it's still the patriarchal sentiment that is against women and sins going on there. And you cannot abolish that mindset of people, so that this problematic situation is not really solved. 

They also said that victims are offended by the attempts to prove that they're not really guilty and that kind of victim sentiment is something that should matter. We don't think that is important because they have not responded to our leader of opposition to stand up for how victims' emotions are not considered in criminal justice, which is a factual thing. But also importantly, that argument is invalid. If that argument is true, they're saying that people who attempt to lighten their punishment by attempting to prove that they were insane at the situation with insanity defense would also be discussing the victim and that the cause of insanity defense ought to be abolished too. Or poor people attempting to prove that they are poor, they have to do this kind of thing, maybe discussing the victim so they're willing to abolish that. But that's not how they made the principle of distinction. I don't think that's how, obviously, it should work. So while we think that argument, even if it's beneficial, does not justify taking this policy.

So thank you. The last practical thing they said was that crimes increase, we want deterrence. We think, obviously, it's just that a 10-year sentence might become an 8-year sentence with the existence of this defense. You have the social sanctions and the criminal sanctions that disconnect it. I don't think that deterrence is the main issue of the debate. But also deterrence is just one part of the clause. So if deterrence is important in that specific case, we might increase the punishment. But that is not a reason to abolish a very distinct and independent power clause that exists in the criminal justice system. So I don't know why abolishment makes sense. Sure. 

<POI>On to your POI, in your plan and compulsive crimes distinction, the interpretation of crime is willful on the side closer to planned murder, for example. We think the interpretation of crime is akin to willful negligence, if all others are true. 

OK, let me deal with that. So, second question. Should the choice of you drinking matter that much? The principle argument coming a bit from Gov is that, you know, you're drunk, you are aware of it, so you should take the responsibility and just face it. That is not really important, because, firstly, I think they had no response to our argument from the leader of our position and the deputy talking about our culpabilities at the core of the criminal justice system, where to the extent that you are trying to impose sanctions on an individual and to the extent that we consider fairness as important, we need a reasonable accusation and grounds that these people are responsible for their acts to impose any punishment on these individuals and why assumption of innocence exists. Obviously, these individuals, because they were not necessarily themselves when they were drunk, they don't remember it, they usually wouldn't do that, which means that the extent that they take responsibility for their acts is decreased and to the extent that even if we agree to that, there's a different parallel reason to consider that they should be decreased of their punishment and why that doesn't really prove any validity in this debate. 

But also importantly, they say that insanity is okay but drunk is bad. We think that's a bad argument. Because, essentially, insanity is not that you are born really mentally vulnerable and you can't think always. The natural reality is that they are mildly mentally ill and are temporarily compulsively doing something and are temporarily rational, or they're not sure about the extent to which they are rational in certain circumstances. Meaning that these people have situations in which they are rational and can take the choice of their thinking about whether they should go into that situation and are aware of the risk that they might go kind of mentally unstable and do these acts and they're not willing to impose on these individuals and understand the distinction.

And the last point about planned crime and composite crime, that's important because their argument is technically saying that you're drunk and you chose that, you should take the full responsibility, distinct from other people that are rational. Meaning that, if you opt into it, if you take the risk of it, you should take the responsibility. Meaning that, if you opt into it and knew that you'd opt into a framework of crime, you should take the responsibility of it. And that's technically saying that a well-planned crime, which you opt into fully, and a composite crime, which you're very compulsively opt in, have no distinction and they have not made any justification of that. And I think that doesn't matter and it doesn't make sense to think it's both.

## Opposition 4th
So, Chair, let's make this debate very simple, because there are many trivial disputes which are actually not the core of this debate. For example, sales forces can avoid drinking, they can quit, they can sue bosses for harassment. Actually, that's not important, even though that's a case coming from our side of the house. What we need to talk about here is that there are some differences of gravity of responsibility between these sales forces punching someone and clearly conscious people punching someone intentionally.

Maybe it's right, but there will be some differences between people who are drunk and people who are not drunk. They may have succeeded to explain the difference is not that big. Yeah, they could explain that. Maybe the difference is not that big. People chose to be drunk, people chose to avoid drinking, that will be the choice of the individual. That's why maybe the difference is not as big as we told you from the beginning.

But the thing is, they couldn't prove there should be no differences of treatment for individuals who are drunk and who are never drunk, and who are consciously punching someone. So, maybe that will already show how we won this debate, but I want to talk about some other government's principle, and I want to clarify why we clearly won this debate.

So, the basic principle coming from their side of the house was that people made a decision to pass the gate that will be connected to crimes, and they are informed of the risk that their action will ultimately lead to some consequences. Okay, let's look at non-toxicated criminals. So, they chose to go outside consciously, they chose to buy a knife consciously, they chose to meet a person they hate consciously, they chose to stab someone, that person consciously, they chose not to call ambulances consciously, everything was conscious in that case.

But conversely, how about intoxicated individuals? They chose to go outside consciously, they chose to go drinking consciously maybe, but they chose to drink a lot, that will be a conscious choice of individuals. They may be aware of some risk at this point, but they didn't choose to buy a knife, they didn't choose to meet a person that they turned to hate, they didn't choose to stab a knife into a person, maybe they even don't remember everything after they actually went drunk.

So, intoxicated criminals are still very bad people, that's also a murder, but they should be sentenced according to the responsibility that they should have expected for the risk that could be, the risk that maybe I will kill someone I hate. But those kinds of expected risks are very different from cases where individuals are very conscious, have a clear mind to kill someone, there will be some differences.

Then, let's go back to the bottom group of the outsider house. We are talking about we should maintain the intoxication defense in the outsider house. We are not saying people shouldn't be mitigated in every circumstance. What they have to prove is there should be no kind of intoxication defense, people should be sentenced equally in every circumstance, even though they have some tiny responsibility, compare them between individuals who are very conscious and people who are not conscious, even though they chose to be drunk.

So, that's why I share a person. So, I think I won this debate already. They couldn't prove there is no any tiny difference between people who chose to drink and who didn't choose to kill someone, and people who are conscious about everything, there will be some differences. That's why that difference should be reflected in the sentences that should be given to individuals because that should be more equal treatment for individuals who are differentiating,  and that will be the most trustable system that we can rely on. For those reasons, I'm very proud to oppose.

## Government 4th
Thank you, Chair. We believe that there are two main theories that lose their case in this debate. First mistake they have made is that the line they draw on intoxication defense is so blurred to an extent that it sounds almost contradictory. At the point in which, Mizogami-san said, when you're drunk, you don't remember anything, and you are basically a different person. Then why and on what ground you are punishing the person? Because if you think that being drunk is so big of a deal to the extent that you don't remember anything, then probably you should not punish this individual at all. But the important point is that you didn't provide the reason as to why you can punish and then draw the line as to why that's legitimate.

The second mistake that they have made is that despite the fact that they keep claiming that there are some cases we should consider, they never really prove to us how that case is important to the extent that we should remain this framework. Because the trade-off that they give us is probably like taking Tamifu without guardian, and do you know the consequence of that? And the consequence is what, right? We don't see the impact, and you didn't really ground the impact as to why taking Tamifu and going out and do something, and your punishment is such a culpable thing, and we think that even if we give the trade-off thing, we think we are actually winning this debate.

But moving on to my issue, which is about is intoxication defense legitimate based on three criteria, I'll talk to you about this in this class, right? But the first reason they have told us is that we should keep this framework itself because citizens' trust is important, and we should be careful about treating individual rights, which is critically rebutted by Dr. Sun saying society now is becoming a hatred, having a hatred to a drinking culture, and this voice is not really heard under the jurisdiction system, and we think that point is dead, right?

But secondly, more importantly, the criteria about the consequence of you being drunk, you are not really fully informed about the consequence of drinking, right? So that's the point I pointed out in the introduction, where if the result is unexpected, then why the hell you can actually punish this individual at all, right? We think when the point meets you, overgenerous, overly illustrated, the effect of the drinking problem, we think you lose the ground on why you can actually punish this individual.

But thirdly, more importantly, the point where you are forced by the boss, and therefore you should be mitigated of this crime, right? Then we think it's not the point, anything that can influence you taking action should be a mitigating factor, right? Maybe you didn't choose to be irritated this morning because I have to wake up early, and you didn't choose that, and you kill someone, and you should be mitigated, right? We think anything then should be a mitigating factor, and we think explicitly, we said drinking and taking medicine without a guardian is the thing that you are doing consciously, therefore you should not be granted the mitigations, right? We think for that reason, I'm very happy to propose that.
